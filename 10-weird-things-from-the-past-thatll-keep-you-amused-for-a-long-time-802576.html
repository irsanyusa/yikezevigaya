For example, the ways to&nbsp;show good manners continue to&nbsp;change and reflect the features of&nbsp;the epoch in&nbsp;which they arise. For example, in&nbsp;medieval France, people would <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>wipe</a> their hands on&nbsp;the tablecloth and drink soup straight from the bowl. Today these gestures would hardly be&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;good manners.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;figure out what weird and unexpected norms existed in&nbsp;the past. Below you will find the ones that evoke a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;emotions&nbsp;— from confusion to&nbsp;slight shock.</p><p><h2>The color of&nbsp;an&nbsp;umbrella mattered.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e92/65e/0d85e259e1af7fdf7f0b8d7a56.jpg><p>British writer Robert Louis Stevenson felt so&nbsp;strongly about proper umbrella <a href=# title=etiquette data-link=tag>etiquette</a> that in&nbsp;1894, he&nbsp;wrote an&nbsp;essay on&nbsp;the topic called <i>The Philosophy of&nbsp;Umbrellas</i>. In&nbsp;his work, he&nbsp;outlined that the rain-protecting device indicated the social position of&nbsp;its owner, while the fabric can say a&nbsp;lot about the owner’s character. Thus, according to&nbsp;the writer, <strong>accessories made of&nbsp;<a href=# title=silk data-link=tag>silk</a> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>were meant</strong></a><strong> for hypocrites</strong>, while gingham umbrellas were for “decent and reputable” people.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was considered bad manners to&nbsp;talk for a&nbsp;long time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/577/89e/3c74285c609deb05a15fd7f05b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Victorian era, the length of&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation, just like any other event of&nbsp;social life, was limited by&nbsp;strict rules. Friends who met on&nbsp;the street <strong>were supposed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;short greeting</strong> so&nbsp;that their stop in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the road would not disturb each other from going about their business. There were special places for extended conversations. For example, people could communicate <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>longer</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;park, which was often a&nbsp;place used for courting.</p><p><h2>Couples could get married only at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c41/625/6d153653e18efee897c42e57f3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the same epoch, <strong>it&nbsp;was illegal to&nbsp;tie the knot after mid-day</strong>. The book called <i>The Habits of&nbsp;Good Society: A&nbsp;Handbook for Ladies and Gentlemen</i> published in&nbsp;1863 <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>mentions</a> this fact. Though the book itself is&nbsp;more than 400 pages long, there are no&nbsp;explanations for this rule in&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Raw meat was used instead of&nbsp;cosmetics.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b15/a90/5360865f32a6fd70cd95fec1de.jpg><p>Today many people try to&nbsp;support their natural beauty and look younger than their real age. For this, they use a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;<a href=# title=cosmetic data-link=tag>cosmetic</a> products, that they hardly even have free space on&nbsp;their shelves.<strong> In&nbsp;Victorian times, a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;raw </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>meat</strong></a><strong> served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;universal cosmetic product. </strong>People believed that a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;raw flesh left on&nbsp;the face overnight would infiltrate its youthful essence into the body through the skin. Apart from that, rubbing any animal fat on&nbsp;the skin was also believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;useful.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was forbidden to&nbsp;lift your dress with both hands.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e1/67a/f2816751d29abf061e616a5b85.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Victorian era, a&nbsp;woman’s behavior outside was limited by&nbsp;certain rules. Thus, when crossing the road, a&nbsp;woman was supposed to&nbsp;lift her <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a> with her right hand slightly over her ankles.<strong> Doing this with both hands was </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>considered</strong></a><strong> vulgar.</strong> Such an&nbsp;indecent gesture could be&nbsp;justified only if&nbsp;the dirt on&nbsp;the road was too deep.</p><p><h2>Parents were told to&nbsp;not play with their kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bd/f3f/9e5b5b58a8a0e0fc14ccc9feb6.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 19th and the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, communication between mothers and children was strikingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>different</a> from what we&nbsp;have today. <strong>Women were advised to&nbsp;not show excessive affection toward their children. </strong>In&nbsp;addition, parents were told to&nbsp;not play with babies until they were 4&nbsp;to&nbsp;6&nbsp;months old.</p><p><h2>Salt was always served with pepper on&nbsp;the table.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab3/3cc/4260815108b67e017fc1791029.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the first half of&nbsp;the 20th century, <strong>it&nbsp;was </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>not customary</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;serve <a href=# title=salt data-link=tag>salt</a> separately from <a href=# title=pepper data-link=tag>pepper</a> during meals</strong>. For example, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest asked for a&nbsp;salt shaker only, one was supposed to&nbsp;pass it&nbsp;together with the pepper shaker. Ignoring this rule was interpreted as&nbsp;disrespect toward a&nbsp;person and was considered a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;good manners.</p><p><h2>One was supposed to&nbsp;smile when talking on&nbsp;the phone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/628/776/cb5cdc5215a240787953120144.jpg><p>Today it’s hard to&nbsp;surprise anyone with a&nbsp;phone call. However, in&nbsp;the ’40s of&nbsp;the 20th century, people considered it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real technological miracle. There were even <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>special rules</a> for communication with the help of&nbsp;such an&nbsp;unusual device. For example, though the person on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the line wasn’t able to&nbsp;see the person they were talking&nbsp;to,<strong> it&nbsp;was still polite to&nbsp;smile and speak clearly during the phone conversation.</strong></p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was not recommended to&nbsp;read and speak on&nbsp;trains.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90c/0bc/f8af145e9381198647f8b86f00.jpg><p>Today, in&nbsp;the 21st century, traveling by&nbsp;train is&nbsp;basically taken as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;finish reading an&nbsp;interesting novel or&nbsp;complete a&nbsp;work task. During the Victorian era, visually impaired travelers <strong>were advised to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;reading books, and those with sore lungs were advised to&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>avoid</strong></a><strong> talking.</strong></p><p><h2>The length of&nbsp;the shoes indicated the owner’s status.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dbf/df2/aee35859a7baa84747b27b1a3b.jpg><p>Clothes used to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;meaning for the medieval elite because they were a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;demonstrate their wealth and overall superiority over the poor. Because of&nbsp;this, Europe came up&nbsp;with many unusual trends. One of&nbsp;them was long pointy shoes for men, also known as&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>poulaines</a>.” <strong>Their length indicated the owner’s position in&nbsp;society: the longer the tip was, the higher the status a&nbsp;person had.</strong></p><p><h2>Spouses were chosen according to&nbsp;phenotype.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d7/124/df097c54b9ac660de5ce541d43.jpg><p>How would you relate to&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where the choice of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=spouse data-link=tag>spouse</a> would be&nbsp;made according to&nbsp;socially accepted canons instead of&nbsp;their mutual feelings? In&nbsp;the Victorian era, people had a&nbsp;rather peculiar approach to&nbsp;the issue of&nbsp;choosing life partners. <strong>Thus, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>those</strong></a><strong> with bright red hair and a&nbsp;florid complexion were recommended to&nbsp;marry someone with jet-black hair.</strong> Very obese people were supposed to&nbsp;marry the thin, while the wiry and cold-blooded were advised to&nbsp;marry those who were round-featured, warm-hearted, and emotional.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the modern traditions seem outdated to&nbsp;you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedaeoKucXam1qrrGrGSfqp%2BierW0xGanmqukYsGprdOlo2ajlZq9bsXOrmSapaWosqV5xaipZpldobyvs4ytoKadXW19c4GWb2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
