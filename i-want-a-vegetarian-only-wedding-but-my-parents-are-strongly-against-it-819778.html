However, this aspiration can sometimes clash with deeply rooted family traditions and preferences. And this is&nbsp;exactly what’s happening to&nbsp;this couple.</p><p>My&nbsp;fiancé and&nbsp;I (both 30s) are getting married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months. We&nbsp;now need to&nbsp;finalize our menu choices for our guests. We&nbsp;are vegetarian. In&nbsp;general, we&nbsp;are pretty relaxed vegetarians.</p><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;go&nbsp;out, we&nbsp;totally don’t mind if&nbsp;our friends/family choose meat or&nbsp;fish to&nbsp;eat, same if&nbsp;we&nbsp;visit family as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;veggie option, then that’s great. Now back to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/551/465/2d3c8753358a705b2f7e12b4bb.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.<br>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>On&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;the choices, and given it’s our day, we&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;fully vegetarian menu. My&nbsp;parents are paying for the meal and have been absolutely stunned by&nbsp;this choice. They say it’s disrespectful to&nbsp;people who aren’t in&nbsp;the vegetarian culture, and also disrespectful to&nbsp;our own values in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;ensuring our friends have a&nbsp;nice time.</p><p>They say it’s forcing our ethics on&nbsp;other people. My&nbsp;viewpoint&nbsp;is: it&nbsp;is&nbsp;one meal only, on&nbsp;our day, where I’m sure it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;delicious whatever they’re served.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/151/e52/374ac9581c92d98140e81cd24f.jpg><p>None of&nbsp;our friends have ever complained when coming to&nbsp;our house for (vegetarian) food, but my&nbsp;parents say it’s different at&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding because people “expect luxury food,” especially if&nbsp;they are traveling from abroad (many are) and apparently this needs to&nbsp;include meat. I&nbsp;am honestly torn on&nbsp;this.</p><p>Personally, I&nbsp;don’t mind that much if&nbsp;our guests eat meat, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;inconsistent with our own life choices, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;our day, so&nbsp;that could make it&nbsp;feel inauthentic. And I&nbsp;think the whole focus on&nbsp;meat thing is&nbsp;quite generational (my&nbsp;parents are in&nbsp;their 60s). My&nbsp;fiancé agrees with&nbsp;me, but the issue is&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents are (very kindly) paying for the meal. Will I&nbsp;be a&nbsp;jerk if&nbsp;I got everyone only vegetarian food?</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>“Omnivores have all eaten plenty of&nbsp;vegetarian and even vegan meals without intending&nbsp;to. It&nbsp;does not seem like it’s pushing anything on&nbsp;anyone, any more than ANY other food choice would&nbsp;be. If&nbsp;you offered chicken, would you be ’pushing chicken onto people’?<br>Your parents may decide not to&nbsp;pay for the meal, and that’s their prerogative. But it’s your day, and this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very reasonable choice to&nbsp;make. This way, you can try or&nbsp;sample all the food on&nbsp;the menu and not be&nbsp;excluded from your own celebration.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>owls_and_cardinals&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“If&nbsp;you really want to&nbsp;have everything exactly your way, then pay for the entire wedding yourself, and that way your parents can’t be&nbsp;blamed.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>busyshrew&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“People can go&nbsp;ONE MEAL without eating meat! My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I are of&nbsp;your parent’s generation, and your idea sounds delicious! Luxury food? What’s not luxury about Eggplant parm, veggie quiche, half of&nbsp;any given Indian menu, stuffed peppers, guacamole, moussaka, asparagus risotto, shakshuka, mushroom wellington, tortellini with alfredo sauce, or&nbsp;stuffed manicotti?” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>KingBretwald&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/063/136/28a70a5cb7bdf7564f7bb3a0f4.jpg><ul><li>“I&nbsp;love meat. I&nbsp;also love vegetables. And if&nbsp;you give me&nbsp;a&nbsp;plate of&nbsp;grilled balsamic vegetables, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;glory. I’m shocked by&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;adults that don’t eat vegetables. If&nbsp;you go&nbsp;vegetarian, I’d go&nbsp;Italian... cheese lasagna, eggplant rollatini, then something vegan to&nbsp;accommodate anyone who is&nbsp;vegan or&nbsp;maybe is&nbsp;just going lower carb.<br>I&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people hear vegetarian and think vegan, there’s nothing wrong with vegan, it’s just gonna be&nbsp;really hard to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;carnivores home full while not offering dairy or&nbsp;eggs.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>MelissaIsBBQing&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;believe your parents have an&nbsp;old-fashioned and narrow view of&nbsp;vegetarian cuisine, and probably imagine that guests will be&nbsp;served only a&nbsp;bowl of&nbsp;salad as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were bunnies.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>000-Hotaru_Tomoe&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“There are tons of&nbsp;vegetarian meals that if&nbsp;you didn’t announce it&nbsp;as&nbsp;vegetarian, no&nbsp;one would bat an&nbsp;eye&nbsp;at. Being non-vegetarian isn’t a&nbsp;dietary restriction that requires one to&nbsp;eat meat at&nbsp;every meal. You might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;jerk if&nbsp;you pick a&nbsp;bad caterer that only does salads and meat substitutes—because no&nbsp;one tends to&nbsp;enjoy that (even vegetarians).<br>Look into caterers that specialize in&nbsp;veggie food. International cuisines with vegetarian roots could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good way to&nbsp;distract from the vegetarianism of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all. Just be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;get allergy info from guests, as&nbsp;you may run into more of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;vegetarian meals tend to&nbsp;introduce more diverse ingredients than your typical meat-potatoes-veg medley caterer.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>onhte_&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Opting for a&nbsp;<a href=#>vegetarian-only wedding</a>, despite strong opposition from one’s parents, underscores the importance of&nbsp;staying true to&nbsp;one’s values. Through open communication, empathy, and a&nbsp;willingness to&nbsp;find compromises, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;wedding that reflects both individual beliefs and family traditions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8Cnq2aZXauyqLHTmqmimZ5ivK%2B42GaunpyUnruoecGuq2alqWK9or7Ep6usZZGnsm6%2F06ump5%2Bcrnqis8CipaysXZ7BboSQcm5wcF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
