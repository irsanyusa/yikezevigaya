Even public figures are not exempt from this. Camila Alves, who is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Matthew McConaughey" data-link=tag>Matthew McConaughey</a> opened up&nbsp;about her own experience with her mother-in-law, calling their relationship “tricky.”</p><p><h2>Camila admitted that her MIL was “testing” her at&nbsp;the beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/820/9c1/f6c8915b929733485312758f8f.jpg><p>Camila Alves McConaughey, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>who</a> has three children with Matthew McConaughey, to&nbsp;whom she has been married since 2012, disclosed that when she initially began dating him in&nbsp;2006, her mother-in-law Mary Kathlene ’Kay’ McCabe, who is&nbsp;now 91&nbsp;years old, began “testing” her.</p><p>“She did all these things when&nbsp;I first came in&nbsp;the picture, right? She was really testing&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;mean, really testing&nbsp;me,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>“She would call me&nbsp;by&nbsp;all of&nbsp;Matthew’s ex-girlfriends’ names, she would start speaking Spanish with me&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very broken way, kind of&nbsp;putting [me] down a&nbsp;bit. I&nbsp;mean, all kinds of&nbsp;stuff.”</p><p><h2>She finally got respect from her MIL when she fought back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f7/3c2/4490645ad28a6ca29f97971399.jpg><p>Camila recounted the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>incident</a> when she finally got her acceptance into the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. After landing a&nbsp;modelling job in&nbsp;Istanbul with extra perks, she invited her mother-in-law along. During the trip, Kay shared stories that were making Camila uneasy. On&nbsp;the third day, her mother-in-law opened up&nbsp;emotionally, and Camila realized she was exaggerating.</p><p>That’s when Camila decided that it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;for herself: “So&nbsp;I&nbsp;just [flipped] it&nbsp;on&nbsp;her and brought my&nbsp;spicy Brazilian, Latin side, and&nbsp;I let her have&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;went back at&nbsp;her, and we&nbsp;had it&nbsp;back and forth, back and forth.” This earned her mother-in-law’s <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> and marked a&nbsp;turning point.</p><p>“From that day&nbsp;on, that night&nbsp;on, we&nbsp;have the most amazing relationship, and&nbsp;I have so&nbsp;much respect for her. She has so&nbsp;much respect for&nbsp;me,” she shared, adding, “It&nbsp;can get tricky sometimes.” However, Camilla explained, “We&nbsp;always end with a&nbsp;good laugh and a&nbsp;joke.”</p><p><h2>Mathew had a&nbsp;strained relationship with his mother too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af2/34f/46d3a858dd85f593c136be8692.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2020, the duo talked about their strong connection and the effort it&nbsp;took to&nbsp;reach their current place.</p><p>Kay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that during the initial stages of&nbsp;Camila and Matthew’s relationship, the two determined and strong-willed individuals were “testing each other.” However, the model perceived the situation differently, stating, “Well I’ll say more you were testing&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Camilla isn’t the only family member who has faced challenges in&nbsp;getting along with Kay at&nbsp;some point. Matthew notably had an&nbsp;eight-year period of&nbsp;not communicating with his mother. This was due to&nbsp;her consistent leaking of&nbsp;their private conversations to&nbsp;the media. Eventually, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;establish “certain boundaries” with her.</p><p>During red-carpet events, McConaughey <a href=#>always</a> brings his mother along as&nbsp;his companion. Moreover, he&nbsp;can’t recall a&nbsp;single day when she went to&nbsp;bed before him or&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;after him the following morning.</p><p>Preview photo credit Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqiwNOhnLBlnZiwsLrArp6hnamoeri1xZ5knJmdnrmiecClrZ6rXaS9prrSZqypZZGXvLbAjJucoZmmnryzedKhnGadnpnCs7HDZp2rp51itaa%2BjKamraCVp3qquoylmLBlaGaBenyWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
