Blend for 1 minute. Then, add two eggs, stir the mixture well and add two eggs more. Keep adding until all the 8 eggs are there. Now, add the mixture of the milk and lemon juice.</p><p class=align-left>Finally, use a sifter to add flour into the mixture. Stir the mass with a spatula.

Split the coconut carefully and collect the juice. Then, gather the meat and grate it so that you receive long thin particles. Try grating along the meat fibers to achieve the necessary form.</p><p class=align-left>Then, pour the collected juice into a pot and add the sugar. Stir so that the sugar melts. Then, add the grated coconut and stir again. This done, add as much water as needed to reach the same level as the grated coconut meat. Cover the pot with its lid and let the mixture boil. Keep stirring the mixture all the time while it’s boiling.</p><p class=align-left>When the water is almost completely evaporated, reduce the heat and watch the mixture closely. When it starts to stick, the sugar is caramelizing. You need to keep on stirring until the coconut is starting to get brown. Now, it’s time to remove the candy. Take it from the pot, spread over a clean flat surface and leave to cool down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2cn6h9j8cr5g.jpg><p class=align-left>These are several very popular, delicious and authentic Nigerian desserts that are able to conquer your heart even if you don’t have a sweet tooth.
