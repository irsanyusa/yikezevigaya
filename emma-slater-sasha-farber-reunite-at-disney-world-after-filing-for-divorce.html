They first started dating in 2011 and, after five years, Farber surprised Slater by proposing during a live broadcast of the reality competition show, Dancing With the Stars. The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony in Los Angeles in March 2018.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all love stories have a fairy tale ending. After four years of marriage, Slater and Farber decided to go their separate ways. However, despite the end of their romantic relationship, sources close to the couple have confirmed that they still remain close and there’s no bad blood between them.</p><p>Recently, Slater shared a series of captivating photos from her time at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a> World, where she participated in the “Dance the World” event. To the surprise and delight of her followers, she was joined by none other than her ex-husband.</p><p>The news of their divorce in April 2022 shocked fans who had admired their beautiful partnership both on and off the dance floor. However, it seems that these two talented dancers have managed to maintain a deep bond of friendship despite the end of their romantic relationship, as they can be seen performing a routine together at Disney World.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Former Couple Extend Their Reunion by Visiting Witney Carson</h2><p>Right after their reunion at Disney World, Slater and Farber also paid a visit to fellow dancer Witney Carson and her family. Despite their ongoing divorce proceedings, the two have maintained a friendly relationship not only with each other but also with their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> colleagues.</p><p>In an Instagram Story, Carson shared a selfie with Slater, Farber, her husband Carson McAllister, and her two sons. Captioning the photo, Carson wrote, “Spent the day with @theemmaslater and @sashafarber1 while they were in town. It was the best day.”</p><p>Carson and McAllister recently relocated from Utah to Florida, shortly after welcoming their second son, Jet, in May. Meanwhile, Slater and Farber were in Orlando fulfilling their teaching commitments at the Dance the World competition. During their visit with Carson and her family, they had the pleasure of meeting baby Jet for the first time.</p><p>Carson affectionately referred to Slater as “Aunt Emma” in a video, showcasing Slater’s nurturing presence as she soothed Jet to sleep.
