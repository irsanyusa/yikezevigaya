These people had been walking in&nbsp;the wrong shoes for so&nbsp;long and decided that it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;change that. Re-assigning their gender was just the first step to&nbsp;find their true selves and start their new lives.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;show you how 12&nbsp;women completely changed their lives when they decided to&nbsp;become men and get the body that feels like home to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>1. Aydian Dowling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e37/338/4f6bbb52a4b17d825cb92d6d72.jpg><p>Aydian is&nbsp;the first transgender man to&nbsp;have ever been featured on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;<a href=#>Gay Times</a> magazine. Before that, <strong>he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;campaign that was trying to&nbsp;get him on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;Men’s Health</strong> and he&nbsp;even appeared on&nbsp;Ellen to&nbsp;maximize his chances, but unfortunately he&nbsp;didn’t succeed. He&nbsp;said that the first time someone saw him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man was the most defining day of&nbsp;his life. That happened while he&nbsp;was waiting in&nbsp;line and a&nbsp;woman behind the counter referred to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;“sir,” which made him feel, for the first time, that he&nbsp;was being seen as&nbsp;the person he&nbsp;always wanted to&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>2. Jaimie Wilson</h2></p><p>Jamie was 18-years-old when he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;start transitioning from female to&nbsp;male. When he&nbsp;announced his decision to&nbsp;his family and friends, almost all of&nbsp;them abandoned him and thought that he&nbsp;was “too feminine” to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. They were shocked to&nbsp;hear the news since, as&nbsp;they said, he&nbsp;didn’t “show any signs” all these years, referring to&nbsp;his feminine look. Even today, <strong>many people accuse him of&nbsp;trying too hard to&nbsp;look like a&nbsp;man.</strong> He&nbsp;isn’t sad anymore about the people that left him, since he’s found new friends in&nbsp;the LGBTQ community and his true identity.</p><p><h2>3. Elijah Stephens</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2be/471/2f3957510da97a2d2cc327d0a4.jpg><p>This man was the first in&nbsp;New Jersey to&nbsp;acquire a&nbsp;man’s reproductive organ. This allows him to&nbsp;experience the entire sensation of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;penis. <strong>The doctors used skin from Elijah’s forearm in&nbsp;an&nbsp;operation that lasted 14&nbsp;hours</strong>. The procedure was successful and, after a&nbsp;while, Elijah learned how to&nbsp;live with and go&nbsp;through his everyday life with his new organ. The best part is&nbsp;that Elijah has had his longtime girlfriend along with him since the first day he&nbsp;started transitioning, and together they’ve overcome all the hurdles.</p><p><h2>4. Ian Harvie</h2></p><p>Ian Harvie is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stand-up comedian who became famous for his role on&nbsp;the popular&nbsp;TV series Transparent and Mistresses. Hollywood categorizes him in&nbsp;the transgender area and he&nbsp;has become a&nbsp;powerful voice for the community’s needs and problems. <strong>When he&nbsp;was young, his mom would put him in&nbsp;dresses on&nbsp;formal occasions</strong>, but he&nbsp;would change back into his boy clothes when they would get back home. Ian first came out as&nbsp;homosexual to&nbsp;his family when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;19, but still felt a&nbsp;weight on&nbsp;his shoulders. This weight was lifted when he&nbsp;transitioned and started his new journey in&nbsp;life. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now advocating for the transgender community and doing stand-up all over the&nbsp;US.</p><p><h2>5. Laith Ashley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43e/b8b/2362f55b828ab877c2b5125f95.jpg><p>Laith is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;very few transgender models with a&nbsp;tremendous career. He&nbsp;was even the first trans man to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the Pit Crew on&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race. He&nbsp;says that he&nbsp;always liked to&nbsp;spend more time with the boys and used to&nbsp;rip his dresses up&nbsp;and rip the bows off of&nbsp;his girly underwear. <strong>He&nbsp;didn’t start his transition until he&nbsp;was almost 25</strong>&nbsp;and after it&nbsp;was complete he&nbsp;saw his modeling career skyrocket. However, there have been cases where people have declined to&nbsp;work with him or&nbsp;represent him right after they learned that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;transgender man. It’s also very hard to&nbsp;find work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor since producers won’t cast him either as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man or&nbsp;a&nbsp;transgender man, simply because they want faces that are visibly transgender and not as&nbsp;masculine as&nbsp;Laith&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>6. Lucas Silveira</h2></p><p>Lucas Silveira is&nbsp;the front man of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Canadian rock &&nbsp;roll band and the first transgender man to&nbsp;be&nbsp;voted Canada’s Sexiest Man Alive. His transition journey began when he&nbsp;ended his 6-year relationship with his then girlfriend. <strong>He&nbsp;spent many years feeling unhappy with his life and thinking that transitioning was impossible so&nbsp;he&nbsp;should just learn to&nbsp;live as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman.</strong> After his breakup, he&nbsp;decided that it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;chase after his true identity, something that affected his band, but only in&nbsp;the beginning. Even today, some people still refer to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;“her” and he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very patient, thinking that they are just ignorant or&nbsp;uncomfortable.</p><p><h2>7. Ryan Sallans</h2></p><p>Ryan Sallans is&nbsp;a&nbsp;published author and a&nbsp;carpenter who decided to&nbsp;start his journey to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;male back in&nbsp;2005. Since that day, <strong>Ryan has been a&nbsp;recognized advocate and spokesperson for the transgender community</strong> and has spoken at&nbsp;over 70&nbsp;universities across the United States. His mission is&nbsp;to&nbsp;educate people around the globe about trans people and prove to&nbsp;them that no&nbsp;matter how afraid you are, you can accomplish anything you want if&nbsp;that’s your destiny.</p><p><h2>8. Shane Ortega</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30a/164/14f7675b80bf64eebd7d977775.jpg><p>Shane Ortega first served in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US army as&nbsp;a&nbsp;female and then as&nbsp;a&nbsp;transgender man in&nbsp;Afghanistan. <strong>His mother is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lesbian and he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;environment surrounded by&nbsp;the LGBTQ community</strong> and its values. Even though he&nbsp;knew the military’s restrictions on&nbsp;homosexuals and transgenders, he&nbsp;didn’t hold back and served his country. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now an&nbsp;advocate for the LGBTQ members of&nbsp;the military and fights to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;lift the ban regarding them joining the armed forces.</p><p><h2>9. Ryan Cassata</h2></p><p>Ryan Cassata is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American musician who had a&nbsp;double mastectomy at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;18. However, <strong>he&nbsp;had already identified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man from the age of&nbsp;13.</strong> He&nbsp;has never taken testosterone&nbsp;— as&nbsp;most trans men do&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;says that one of&nbsp;the biggest issues in&nbsp;his everyday life is&nbsp;walking in&nbsp;public restrooms, where he&nbsp;sometimes gets verbally or&nbsp;even physically attacked. He&nbsp;has appeared on&nbsp;famous&nbsp;TV shows, including Larry King Live, and is&nbsp;constantly trying to&nbsp;help people who are now going through this transition.</p><p><h2>10. Leo Sheng</h2></p><p>Leo Sheng started his transition back in&nbsp;2014, when he&nbsp;also had his first major surgery. He&nbsp;has been sharing his journey on&nbsp;Instagram in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;try and teach people about what transitioning means and what it&nbsp;takes. It&nbsp;took him a&nbsp;long time until he&nbsp;could post anything from his childhood or&nbsp;early teen years, due to&nbsp;the feminine clothing and persona he&nbsp;had. At&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;pretended like that time never existed in&nbsp;his life. <strong>His goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;lift the stigma off the transgender community</strong> and make people realize that trans people are just like everyone else.</p><p><h2>11. Elliot Fletcher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b84/3cc/b314f95d4c844efd66bb1fa975.png><p>Elliot Fletcher is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most successful young trans male actors in&nbsp;Hollywood, having played in&nbsp;series like Faking It, The Fosters and Shameless. He&nbsp;also participated in&nbsp;the first sexual scene between a&nbsp;<a href=#>cisgender</a> and a&nbsp;transgender person on&nbsp;TV and <strong>his goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first transgender superhero.</strong> He&nbsp;always identified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man and he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;end his life twice during his school years, simply because he&nbsp;couldn’t live as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. Everyone would always refer to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and he&nbsp;preferred being dead to&nbsp;living this way. Then, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;17, he&nbsp;came out to&nbsp;his parents as&nbsp;transgender and asked his teachers to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;“him” and not “her.” Now, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;happier than ever with the way he&nbsp;looks and surrounds himself only with people who love and understand him.</p><p><h2>12. Chris Mosier</h2></p><p>Chris Mosier is&nbsp;a&nbsp;triathlete who was a&nbsp;catalyst in&nbsp;changing the guidelines for the participation of&nbsp;transgender athletes in&nbsp;international games. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the first athlete to&nbsp;be&nbsp;included on&nbsp;the&nbsp;US team and was also the first to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Nike advertisement. He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;date a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;guys back in&nbsp;his college days, but one day he&nbsp;met a&nbsp;woman that later became his wife. <strong>He&nbsp;had trouble identifying as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lesbian and always thought that he&nbsp;was heterosexual.</strong> The reason for that was that he&nbsp;didn’t identify as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. He&nbsp;also felt disappointed with his body and was never okay with his breasts, until he&nbsp;started transitioning back in&nbsp;2010. His wife not only supported him through the journey, but he&nbsp;also achieved more records in&nbsp;his career competing against male athletes during this time.</p><p>How strong do&nbsp;you think someone must be&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;change like this and face all the difficulties that come with&nbsp;it?
