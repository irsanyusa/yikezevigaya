Before I could protest that it wasn’t my size, she encouraged me to give it a go, and I was shocked. It fit perfectly! This is something large-busted people deal with regularly—whether shopping for strapless, wireless, lacy balconettes, or smooth t-shirt styles, there’s so much variety in sizing. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kimmay Caldwell</a> has helped thousands of women find bras they feel great in, and she agrees. ”There really is a bra out there for everyone, even when you think no bra fits you correctly,” she says. When shopping for a bra for large breasts, the most important thing to bring is a willingness to get it wrong—to try styles, shapes, and fabrics from different brands as you determine what works best for you.</p><p>Caldwell says people with full busts often get discouraged in a world where DD is seen as big, making G hard to find in some stores. But with independent boutiques, department stores, and websites stocking an ever-growing range of styles, brands, and sizes in a rainbow of colors and a huge array of fabrics, there's never been a better time to be shopping for full-busted bras. Below, I’ve rounded up some of my favorites that will have you covered at the office, at the gym, and out on the town!</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-bras-for-large-breasts>Our top picks for the best bras for large breasts</h2><h3>Best affordable bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Felina Amaranth Plush T-Shirt Bra with Sheer Details</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Felina Amaranth Plush T-Shirt Bra with Sheer Details</h3></p><p>Bras meant for larger busts do have a reputation for being more expensive, and while there’s some truth to that, it’s not impossible to find a great full-bust bra at an equally great price. Felina, a lingerie brand known for their solid basics (and for making one of the best t-shirt bras), offers this one for less than $50, and it really does it all. Smooth enough to wear under a t-shirt, it also works as a plunge bra, giving you more flexibility when it comes to necklines.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: C - H</li><li>Number of colors: Four</li><li>Style: T-shirt bra</li><li>Price on publish: $45</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Great quality for the price point</li><li>Versatile—will work under a wide variety of necklines</li><li>U-shaped back helps straps stay put</li><li>Lays flat under clothing</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Some people might prefer more coverage</li><li>Color range is limited</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Felina Amaranth Plush T-Shirt Bra is a versatile pick with nice details for those on a budget.</p><h3>Best minimizer-style bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Parfait Enora Minimizer Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Parfait Enora Minimizer Bra</h3></p><p>A <a rel=alternate href=#>minimizer bra</a> is a key tool in a full-busted person’s underwear wardrobe. By shifting the breast tissue placement, it can give the appearance of a smaller, smoother bust—making it a great option for tighter-fitting knits and button-down shirts. The button-gape struggle is real! This one, from Parfait, gives the appearance of going down a full cup size, thanks to the three-part cup and diamond-pattern lace structure.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: C - K</li><li>Number of colors: Four</li><li>Style: Minimizer bra</li><li>Price on publish: $52</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Button-down shirts can be tough to wear when you have a full bust, and this bra makes it easier!</li><li>Light compression, so you won’t feel strapped down</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Sizing can be uneven</li><li>Creates a flatter shape, which some people don’t like</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Parfait Enora Minimizer Bra lifts and supports while reducing the appearance of your bust by a full cup size.</p><h3>Best everyday bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Skims Fits Everybody T-shirt Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Skims Fits Everybody T-shirt Bra</h3></p><p>Leave it to Kim Kardashian to come up with the best basic bra to hit the market in years. This Skims bra quickly became a cult favorite, and with good reason. It’s smooth, making it practically invisible under even the closest fitting t-shirts and bodysuits, and the underwire offers a subtle lift without veering into Wonderbra territory. The full size range is offered in every color, from nude tones to neon green and yellow. Shopping tip: If you’re looking to stock your underwear drawer, Skims is a good starting point. The brand made our lists for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bras</a> of the year, the <a rel=alternate href=#>best cotton underwear</a> , and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best shapewear</a>.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 30 - 46</li><li>Cup sizes: A - H</li><li>Number of colors: At recent count, 16, with more appearing each season</li><li>Style: T-shirt bra</li><li>Price on publish: $54</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>One of the most size-inclusive options on the list</li><li>Fast shipping—I ordered one of these and it arrived in two days</li><li>Matching underwear available in a wide array of styles</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>A little on the low-cut side</li><li>Some colors are limited edition, so once they’re gone, they’re gone</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>With a wide range of colors and inclusive size range, the Skims Fits Everybody T-Shirt Bra is one of the best bras out there.</p><h3>Best underwire bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Panache Clara Bra</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/bz0fvtkbk5r1/119BEFE0s9N3Woucjm09gt/c66d96cdda47334bc9a7421b194dad2f/PN112BLG-main.jpg alt="Panache Clara Bra" title="Panache Clara Bra" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Panache Clara Bra</h3></p><p>I love this bra so much, I almost didn’t want to put it on this list for fear of it selling out! I don’t believe in gatekeeping though, so here it is: an unlined, yet still sturdy underwire that offers full coverage while lifting and separating. It’s a bra I reach for whether I’m wearing a turtleneck sweater or something that dips below my collarbone. The lacy edges are pretty (and not at all itchy), and since the brand releases new colorways each season, it’s possible to find deep discounts on past-season versions.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 28 - 40 (varies by color)</li><li>Cup sizes: D - J</li><li>Number of colors: Between eight and twelve at any given time, including several nudes, black, and brighter pinks and blues</li><li>Style: Full cup, unlined</li><li>Price on publish: $71</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Side-sling construction pushes breasts forward without too much lift</li><li>Pretty without being over-the-top fancy</li><li>Easy to find on sale, if you’re willing to take a chance on a non-standard color</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Basic colors rarely go on sale</li><li>People with lace aversions will want to avoid this one</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Panache Clara Bra offers full cup coverage in a lace-and-satin, unlined underwire.</p><h3>Best seamless bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Honeylove V-Neck Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Honeylove V-Neck Bra</h3></p><p>Many bras for large busts rely on intricate construction, which can sometimes result in seams running down the sides and fronts of the cups. For those of us who want to avoid the dreaded seam-line-under-a-thin-shirt scenario, there’s this bra from shapewear brand, Honeylove. Bonded seams lay flat against the skin, and the wire-free cups lift and separate—no uniboob here! The straps on this one are wide, which many bra-wearers report as a key part of a comfortable fit.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: XS - 3X</li><li>Cup sizes: N/A</li><li>Number of colors: Eight, including a variety of nude tones</li><li>Style: V-neck, wireless</li><li>Price on publish: $64</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Seams won’t leave marks on skin or show under clothes</li><li>Comfortable but still offers some structure</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The sizing may be tricky for people used to going by standard band and cup sizes</li><li>Since it’s wire-free, you won’t get a ton of lift from this one</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Honeylove V-Neck Bra offers bonded seams that lay flat and a comfortable, wire-free construction.</p><h3>Best sports bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Panache Ultimate High Impact Underwire Sports Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Panache Ultimate High Impact Underwire Sports Bra</h3></p><p>Sports bras, says Caldwell, are something many full-busted people struggle with, and for good reason. Running or other high-impact cardio in an unsupportive bra can genuinely be painful for people with large breasts, and many retailers don’t stock a great selection of sizes. This in turn leads many people with large breasts to avoid sports bras altogether. Panache comes through again here, with a sports bra that combines moisture-wicking fabric with silicone-encased underwire for a sports bra that separates breasts, keeps them supported, and reduces bounce by over 80%. Order this one before your next pickleball match and thank me later!</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 28 - 40</li><li>Cup sizes: B - J</li><li>Number of colors: Eleven, including basic black and white and peppy purple tie-dye</li><li>Style: Underwire sports bra that can be worn as a racerback</li><li>Price on publish: $75</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Encapsulated cups offer tons of support to each individual breast</li><li>Some colors are on sale for as little as $29.99</li><li>A brand with a great reputation amongst full-bust shoppers</li><li>Wide, cushioned straps</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>If you’re not sale shopping, it can be pricey!</li><li>Might show under certain kinds of workout clothes</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>With the support of encapsulated cups and cushioned straps, the Panache Ultimate High Impact Underwire might be one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sports bras</a> out there.</p><h3>Best strapless bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Wacoal Red Carpet Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Wacoal Red Carpet Strapless Bra</h3></p><p>Strapless bras and full-bust figures often have an adversarial relationship, whether it’s a bra not offering enough support or cups that have to be hoisted up every five minutes. This Wacoal bra is a game-changer for those who dream of spaghetti-strap dresses and wide necklines, and it’s got the reviews to prove it. Thousands of shoppers wax poetic about its support, shape, and durability. This is the bra I wore on my wedding day—in fact, I bought it before I even had my dress, and carried it with me in my purse to shopping and fitting appointments.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 30 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: B - I</li><li>Number of colors: Four</li><li>Style: Strapless, full coverage</li><li>Price on publish: $76</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Stays up even during the most raucous dance parties</li><li>Size range is extensive</li><li>Stocked at most major department stores</li><li>Comes with straps that can be worn one-shoulder, crisscross, halter, or traditional</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>It’s not cheap, and it rarely goes on sale</li><li>Offers a fair amount of coverage, so might show under something ultra low-cut</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Wacoal Red Carpet Strapless Bra offers a wide size range and full coverage cups edged in silicone to keep them in place.</p><h3>Best bralette for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cosabella Never Say Never Curvy Sweetie Bralette</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Cosabella Never Say Never Curvy Sweetie Bralette</h3></p><p>Whether you’re lounging around the house or bopping around town, sometimes you want a bra that’s barely a bra—you want a bralette. Cosabella, an Italian lingerie brand beloved for its iconic thong underwear, gave full-bust shoppers something to talk about with this bralette. It’s designed specifically for curvier folks. Available in a lacy nude, it’s the kind of thing you throw on before a Zoom call you forgot about, and in a flirty pink, it looks great peeking out of an oversized t-shirt.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: XS - XL</li><li>Cup sizes: N/A</li><li>Number of colors: Four, including bright red and inky black</li><li>Style: Bralette</li><li>Price on publish: $80</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable—many shoppers report this one feels like wearing nothing</li><li>Designed for fuller busts, offers more coverage than other bralettes on the market</li><li>Adjustable straps</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Not the bra to reach for when you’re looking for a ton of lift and support</li><li>Pricier than some of the other options on this list</li><li>Size range is comparatively limited</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>This pull-on Cosabella bralette is comfortable enough for staying in or going out, and it offers more coverage for fuller busts.</p><h3>Best balconette bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Soma Stunning Support Smooth Balconette Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Soma Stunning Support Smooth Balconette Bra</h3></p><p>Balconette bras are great for lower cut tops and dresses, since the lower cup means you won’t spot any lace, satin, or cotton peeking out from behind your neckline. Fuller-bust shoppers, including yours truly, sometimes have difficulty finding a balconette bra that doesn’t make us feel too exposed. This one is great because the sweetheart neckline offers more coverage than a standard balconette, but still dips low enough for even deep scoop and V-neck tops. As an added bonus, the smoothing back is really smoothing, so much so that I’d reach for this as an everyday t-shirt bra, too.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: A - G</li><li>Number of colors: Five, including four shades of nude</li><li>Style: Balconette, smoothing</li><li>Price on publish: $64</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>It’s a balconette-style bra that doesn’t leave too much skin exposed</li><li>Smoothing back is a nice addition</li><li>Fast shipping and easy returns</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Bulkier than some other balconette options</li><li>Color range is limited</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>This smooth satin bra by Soma offers more coverage than the average balconette but it’s still great with low-cut tops and dresses.</p><h3>Best plunge bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>ThirdLove 24/7® Classic Uplift Plunge Bra</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>ThirdLove 24/7® Classic Uplift Plunge Bra</h3></p><p>Thirdlove is a relatively new player in the bra space, but a solid one—the direct-to-consumer brand’s offerings increase every year, and they offer styles and sizes that work for larger busts. This plunge-style bra comes with removable pads that let you customize how much cleavage you want to show, a great option for fuller-busted people for whom plunge bras almost always equal a lot of cleavage. A 60-day free return policy helps this one stand out, too!</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: A - H</li><li>Number of colors: Eight</li><li>Style: Plunge bra with removable padding</li><li>Price on publish: $72</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Solid array of colors</li><li>Smoothing sides and back</li><li>No-slip straps</li><li>Brand has a good return policy</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>You’ll have to order and try on at home</li><li>Size range could be bigger</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>With removable cups, this customizable plunge bra by Thirdlove is great for day or night.</p><h3>Best wireless bra for large breasts: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Bravissimo Cici Non-Wired Bra</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/bz0fvtkbk5r1/3XWPWMuYKatRYTt3ecMh1Q/a547074d057e829b601ea5befd2a0afe/LN639BLP-main.jpg alt="Bravissimo Cici Non-Wired Bra" title="Bravissimo Cici Non-Wired Bra" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Bravissimo Cici Non-Wired Bra</h3></p><p>Based in the UK, Bravissimo is a one-stop shopping emporium for full-busted people, selling brands like Freya and Panache as well as their own house line, which is where I spotted and quickly fell for this wireless bra. The cups are separate, which helps avoid the uniboob effect that many wireless bras create, and the side-slung cups push breasts subtly forward, giving a natural shape without any wires. The fabric is light and soft, and these last.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 30 - 40</li><li>Cup sizes: D - J</li><li>Number of colors: Just one—a lovely blush pink</li><li>Style: Wireless, full coverage</li><li>Price on publish: $76</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Offers as much support as a wired bra</li><li>Soft fabric is great for anyone who avoids lace and mesh</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>It only comes in one color</li><li>A pricier pick</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>The Bravissimo Cici Non-Wired Bra offers as much support as a wired bra in a lovely shade of pink.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-bras-for-large-breasts>How we chose the best bras for large breasts</h2><p>Everyone’s breasts and bra preferences are different, so in addition to consulting with experts, looking at my own purchase history and most reached-for bras, I also read reviews and polled trusted shoppers.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-bras-for-large-breasts>What to consider when choosing bras for large breasts</h2><h3>Where you’re going</h3><p>If you’re buying a bra for a special occasion or to wear under a specific type of clothing, that’s information you’ll want to have handy while shopping, whether it’s in person or online. Something that looks great under a button-down might not work under a cocktail dress.</p><h3>How much coverage and support you want</h3><p>If you’re looking for a bra with full-breast coverage, stick to styles like t-shirt bras and others that offer a higher-cut cup. Balconette and demi styles are lower cut, which usually means more cleavage. Underwire bras are generally, though not always, more supportive than wireless bras.</p><h3>How much you’re looking to spend</h3><p>Bras for full-bust people can sometimes reach three-digit price points, but that doesn’t mean you have to spend a ton to get a ton of support or coverage. Setting a budget will help you narrow down a range of bras, and you might get great deals if you’re willing to consider more out-there colors and patterns.</p><h3>Know your current measurements</h3><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>ThirdLove</a>, 80% of women wear the wrong bra size. You know your current bra size is incorrect if the cups gap, the back travels upwards, the straps constantly fall off your shoulders no matter how you adjust them, or if it feels uncomfortably tight. Bra sizing consists of the band size and a cup size. To find your numbers, grab a measuring tape and wear a non-padded bra.</p><p>To get your band size, measure around your ribcage under your bust, where your bra band sits. Hold the measuring tape tight, but not so tight that it digs into your skin. ThirdLove then recommends adding two inches (if its an even number), or three inches (if its an odd number) to the measurement to accommodate for the elastic in most bra bands.</p><p>To get your cup size, position the measuring tape around your chest at the fullest part of your breast. Then, subtract the band size from your bust size (without the extra 2-3 inches). ThirdLove refers to this number as the “overbust differential” and it corresponds to cup size. So, if the differential is 0 (as in the bust measurement and the band size measurement are the same), this would correspond to an AA cup; if the differential is 1, this would be an A cup; if the differential is 2, a B cup; and so on.</p><p>As a final note on measurements, consider the shape of your breast and the style of your bra. If you notice your breast shape is fuller towards the bottom but you don’t have as much volume towards the top, a demi-cup or balconette style may work best for you.</p><h2 id=what-type-of-bra-is-best-for-a-large-chest>What type of bra is best for a large chest?</h2><p>The great thing about this question is that there’s no right answer! Whatever style you prefer absolutely exists in large-bust sizes—I promise!</p><h2 id=how-should-a-bra-for-large-breasts-fit>How should a bra for large breasts fit?</h2><p>Just like when shopping for bras for small breasts, the cups of bras for large breasts should lie flat. If you notice there’s extra space, try a smaller cup size. The band should also lie flat without digging into your skin.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is considered a large breast size?</h3><p>D cups and above are considered large, and remember—the alphabet doesn’t stop at DD! Bras come in a range of large sizes, with some retailers stocking bras in cup sizes I or J. Remember, band size and cup size are different, so someone who wears a size 32G will have different bra needs than someone who wears a 42D.</p><h3>Do large breasts need support?</h3><p>People with fuller busts will often reach for supportive bras for a number of reasons. Comfort is a big one, as is considering how a bra will work under clothing. Lower-support styles like bralettes and <a rel=alternate href=#>wireless bras</a> come in larger sizes, but how much support you want is a choice only you can make.</p><h3>Are underwired bras better for large breasts?</h3><p>There’s no “always” in bra shopping, but an underwired bra is often going to offer more support and stability to people with full busts. Underwires get a bad rap, in large part because so many people wear versions that don’t work for them. Don’t be afraid to try different sizes, styles, and brands when looking for an underwired bra.</p><h3>Which bra is best for heavy breasts?</h3><p>There is no one bra that will be best for everyone with heavy breasts, as shape, size, and body proportions all play factors into how a bra fits. Look for one that’s both comfortable and supportive, and consider getting a professional fitting.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
