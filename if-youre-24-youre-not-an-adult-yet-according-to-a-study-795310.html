We&nbsp;think that when we&nbsp;turn&nbsp;18, we’ll finally know what it&nbsp;feels like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;grown-up, with all the perks. And while the United Nations <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> an&nbsp;adolescent is&nbsp;a&nbsp;person between 10&nbsp;and 19&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age, a&nbsp;new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> claims you’re still not an&nbsp;adult at&nbsp;24.</p><p>We, at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> decided to&nbsp;find out why scientists believe that those who were considered adults earlier are now seen as&nbsp;adolescents. Let’s see what the <a href=# title=research data-link=tag>research</a> says.</p><p><h2>How our brain and body change</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/099/c49/bc97fb52bf92d524ee9665163b.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Adolescence</a> starts with puberty. And because health and nutrition have become better in&nbsp;the past decades, it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>now begins at&nbsp;10</a>, when certain hormones become activated.</p><p>Surprisingly, the previous definition of&nbsp;adolescence didn’t take biological development into account when deciding when this life phase ends. While it&nbsp;was considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;19, many biological changes continue into a&nbsp;person’s 20s.</p><p>For example, wisdom teeth typically come in&nbsp;when you are in&nbsp;your mid-20s. Certain brain maturation processes that are crucial to&nbsp;social relationships also occur during this decade. The new definition takes these biological changes into account, which is&nbsp;why these findings can be&nbsp;considered more accurate.</p><p><h2>Our social roles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7d/ac5/7b4ce85dfbb0ef5681818aa6a9.jpg><p>Young adults, who are 24&nbsp;and under, can still be&nbsp;considered adolescents because their major life milestones are delayed. People are marrying and becoming parents later. In&nbsp;the USA, the average marriage age in&nbsp;the 1960s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> around 20&nbsp;for women, and it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> to&nbsp;28&nbsp;in&nbsp;2015.</p><p><a href=# title=Education data-link=tag>Education</a> has become more accessible and affordable, and people are deciding to&nbsp;dedicate more time to&nbsp;that and to&nbsp;training before getting a&nbsp;job. It&nbsp;can also be&nbsp;difficult for some young adults to&nbsp;become financially independent. They still need support from their parents, which makes them semi-dependent, meaning they’re not fully adults even though their age says they are.</p><p><h2>Why it’s important to&nbsp;define who adolescents are</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef2/af4/87a17d5068a0e42ed8776228f3.jpg><p>To&nbsp;define who an&nbsp;adolescent&nbsp;is, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;our biology and at&nbsp;recent social changes combined. This definition should also become part of&nbsp;our laws and social policies.</p><p>This can help improve the overall well-being of&nbsp;young people, with their health, education, and employment benefitting from this. For example, raising the age of&nbsp;adolescence to&nbsp;24&nbsp;could help provide housing to&nbsp;this age group during transitional life stages.</p><p>Healthcare policies often expect adolescents to&nbsp;either be&nbsp;financially supported by&nbsp;their parents, or&nbsp;fully independent. Because people in&nbsp;their 20s, especially, need <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a>, sexual health, and substance abuse services, and because many of&nbsp;them still rely on&nbsp;financial support from their parents, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;them can’t afford to&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;possible problem</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bba/c4c/4f62db54b1b48249d5d79eb822.jpg><p>Because some young adults would still be&nbsp;considered adolescents, they could be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;incompetent by&nbsp;those who are older than them and who are legally considered adults. So, important social and political decisions, some of&nbsp;which might affect their age group directly, could be&nbsp;made without their participation.</p><p>In&nbsp;the <a href=# title=workplace data-link=tag>workplace</a>, this could make young people feel like they aren’t being taken seriously and like their decisions and opinions don’t carry as&nbsp;much weight as&nbsp;those of&nbsp;their adult colleagues. And it’s not because they themselves feel that they’re not ready or&nbsp;don’t have enough experience, but because others see them that way.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this new age range of&nbsp;adolescence? Do&nbsp;you think that young people are becoming adults later? Have you noticed this change in&nbsp;the past years?
