While her portrayal brought her widespread recognition and success, it&nbsp;also brought to&nbsp;light a&nbsp;flaw in&nbsp;her character that she hadn’t been aware of&nbsp;before joining the fantasy series.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the series, Clarke was very young.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c31/bdc/78991b5946ab3035e9d1918e90.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the young age of&nbsp;23&nbsp;and with limited screen experience, Emilia Clarke was cast as&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryen in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones </i></a>shortly after completing drama school. Looking back, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realizes</a> that she couldn’t fully comprehend the show’s magnitude and impact on&nbsp;her life then. “The experience was so&nbsp;enormous and so&nbsp;all-consuming, and defines me&nbsp;at&nbsp;that young moment in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>She was unaware of&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant aspect of&nbsp;her character’s role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/38f/2fe/dab4885d67b812e35dd449011a.png><p>Emilia Clarke revealed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;podcast that she used to&nbsp;feel emotional and <a href=#>cry</a> before filming intimate scenes with <a href=# title="Jason Momoa" data-link=tag>Jason Momoa</a>. Surprisingly, she had accepted the role without being fully aware of&nbsp;these explicit scenes.</p><p>Looking back on&nbsp;that time, Clarke opened up&nbsp;about the situation during an&nbsp;interview, confessing, “I&nbsp;took the job, and then they sent me&nbsp;the scripts, and&nbsp;I was reading them, and&nbsp;I was like, ’Oh, there’s the catch!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/673/dad/6df3ed572189419dbceb7e10fc.jpg><p>Although Emilia Clarke had concerns at&nbsp;first, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>handled</a> her role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional manner. Fortunately, Jason Momoa, who portrayed her character’s ill-fated husband, Khal Drogo, always made the situation more comfortable for her.</p><p><h2>During the filming process, Jason Momoa showed great consideration toward others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/124/8d2/71f6775b03bc7f0f4b9efab095.png><p>Emilia Clarke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke</a> in&nbsp;more detail about how Jason Momoa supported her during the difficult scenes. She thanked him for his kindness and expertise in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, which made her feel more at&nbsp;ease on&nbsp;set. Jason went the extra mile to&nbsp;ensure Emilia’s well-being, even requesting a&nbsp;robe when she was cold between scenes.</p><p>Emilia values Jason’s thoughtfulness and compassion as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fellow human being. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a>, “He&nbsp;was crying more than I&nbsp;was,” and feels fortunate to&nbsp;have had such a&nbsp;supportive co-star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdf/cc5/093857585fb6fb48bcaf07e3f6.jpg><p><h2>After her role in&nbsp;the series she grew and developed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ac/96d/749f1d5ed4ae1a09fbc4a5029d.jpg><p>Jason Momoa’s thoughtfulness towards Emilia Clarke during filming demonstrates his professionalism and kindness. Creating a&nbsp;safe and comfortable environment for actors, especially during sensitive scenes, is&nbsp;crucial. Momoa’s actions showed that he&nbsp;prioritized Clarke’s well-being. It&nbsp;shows that maybe Khal Drogo’s tough exterior didn’t fully reflect Momoa’s true character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/090/db2/faf3e35c31bdc20f005502dadd.jpg><p>Even with the difficulties she faced, Clarke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledges</a> that Game of&nbsp;Thrones played a&nbsp;vital role in&nbsp;kickstarting her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> and gaining widespread recognition. As&nbsp;she gained more experience, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> more assertive, advocating for her comfort on&nbsp;set. She made the decision to&nbsp;decline scenes that made her uneasy, despite facing pressure from others.</p><p>Clarke is&nbsp;not the only actor who has spoken about filming intimate scenes. Many actors, like <a href=# title="Liam Neeson" data-link=tag>Liam Neeson</a>, have <a href=#>expressed</a> their discomfort too. Neeson, known for his intense and dramatic performances, has openly shared his reluctance to&nbsp;shoot such scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLKutcuimGabnJa%2FrLGMmpumoaSoeri02GaqoZ1dmL%2BqscNmmZ6en6eybrLIpaSippdisrm8y6KaoqxdqLCmusSsZLChpJ16q63SqKVmpZ%2BivKJ5l2pqb2lhZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
