The Kingdom of Ghana/Ghanata/Wagadugu was one of the most powerful African empires for thousands of years.</p><p>It was one of the first of the great medieval trading empires of western Africa during the 7th–13th century and was situated between the Sahara and the headwaters of the Sénégal and Niger rivers. At that time it was far more developed than any European country.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>2. The Nok Civilization is considered to be one of the most advanced ancient sub-Saharan civilizations in African history. Beginning sometime around 1500 BC and was largely concentrated in Nigeria. It produced some of the first sub-Saharan iron smelting and terracotta architecture. They mysteriously disappeared around 200 AD.</p><p>3. Mansa Musa I of Mali is the richest human being in all history. The 14th-century king was named the richest person in all history by the Celebrity Net Worth website.</p><p>Mansa Musa I ruled West Africa’s Malian Empire in the early 1300s, making his fortune by exploiting Mali’s salt and gold production.</p><p>4. West Africa is more culturally diverse than the whole of Asia. Nigeria alone has over 500+ languages. More languages are spoken in Taraba state than in 30 countries.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>5. Liberia is Africa's first independent country.
