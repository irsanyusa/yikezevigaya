So, If you’re up for some added spice in your life (sorry, your meals), Gino Tomato Paste is your go-to. This affordable and versatile ingredient can take your cooking adventures from zero to a hundred.</p><p>Speaking of adventures, the country’s current economic situation has led to lots of kitchen explorers, with people finding substitutes and creating new recipes that help cut costs. Just when we thought we had seen it all, the creation of cucumber and carrot stew came about. However, nothing beats the versatility and flavour of Gino Tomato Paste as the ultimate kitchen staple.</p><p>Check out these five delightful Nigerian meals to prepare using this magical ingredient.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Jollof Rice:</strong></p><p>No Nigerian party is complete without the iconic Jollof rice. This dish is the life of the party, and with Gino party jollof, you get to experience that bottom pot party jollof taste. This dish is not just a crowd-pleaser, but it's also easy to whip up, and guaranteed to make your stomach do a happy dance. Consider frying the tomato paste with your onions and spices to get its full flavour potential, with an irresistible aroma before adding your rice. You can also pair this with a properly marinated chicken, adding BAMA mayonnaise as a marinating ingredient to make the chicken incredibly moist and packed with flavour. Now top it all with Coleslaw consisting of fresh veggies and a bit of Mayonnaise to make it creamy.</p><p><strong>Assorted Sauce:</strong></p><p>This amazing dish is an easy-to-make sauce that mixes up your choice of protein with some tomato paste, your favourite spices, and some blended pepper mix. Consider using the Gino pepper and onion paste to give the sauce a rich flavour and an extra taste. The versatility of this sauce makes it a must-try as it can be paired with anything you would love to try it with, like your rice, bread, yam, or anything you would love it with. Not only does this sauce offer a satisfying taste, but it also proves that delicious meals don’t have to be expensive.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5b66a87b-2e1d-4a8e-b292-6bd16d9ee377 data-caption="Feeling adventurous: Here are 5 Nigerian foods to prepare with Gino tomato paste"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/xx6ktkpTURBXy9kYjdlZDU1YjI5YTAwOTIxN2MyNzMwMDQ1MWE1YjI4ZC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNA9zCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Vegetable Soup:</strong></p><p>For students or anyone on a budget, do you know you can still enjoy a local dish on a low budget? Consider Vegetable Soup (Efo Riro) which is a nutrient-packed dish that's both affordable and delicious. The preparation is just as simple as cooking up a pepper mixture using tomato paste, dried pepper, your choice of spices, and a bit of blended pepper mix for a rich, flavorful base, then add your choice of chopped vegetable leaves, and the meal is ready. So if you want to enjoy a local dish on a budget, you should consider trying this. This soup pairs wonderfully with swallow, like eba, fufu, semo, or even rice. It's a budget-friendly, nutritious option that does not skimp on flavour or health benefits.</p><p>Porridge is the ultimate comfort food, and with Gino Tomato Paste, it’s taken to a whole new level. This dish features tender chunks of yam, or potato for a cheaper option cooked in a luscious tomato and pepper sauce. And you don’t have to leave the porridge looking dry and ordinary, spice things up by adding pieces of fish, your preferred assorted proteins, and some chopped vegetable leaves. The paste adds a rich depth of flavour that perfectly complements the sweetness of the yam/potato. You can consider adding more of the tomato paste to your base for a thicker, and more flavorful sauce.</p><p><strong>Nigerian Spaghetti:</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Spaghetti is another comfort meal, but it is you who wants “pasta.” But what if I told you that you can enjoy premium, sweet, and exquisite-looking spaghetti or should I say pasta, with just tomato paste? Similar to how jollof rice is made, start by sautéing your onions, then add your preferred spices to your taste. You could consider opting for Gino pepper and onions to give it that extra taste. Be careful not to use too much tomato paste, so it doesn't get too thick. Let the paste cook for a bit, then add water and your per-boiled pasta. In no time, your dish will be good to go. For a finishing touch, consider adding chopped bell pepper to make it look even more appealing. And there you have it, your meal is ready!</p><p>Whether you're preparing a lavish feast or a simple meal, Gino Tomato Paste ensures consistent flavour and quality, making it a staple in every Nigerian kitchen. So, next time you're feeling adventurous and want to bring a taste of Nigeria to your table, reach for Gino Tomato Paste. Your taste buds and your wallet will thank you!</p><p><strong>#FeatureByGino</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLLEnqOippdirqXCxKerrqqfqsBugYynoKCdop6ur3nFqKadq12pvG680Z6nmqqVYsSqwMdmnqKmn2LBsLnAraZmqJGowaZ7z6Wdcmmjqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
