According to Clarkson, Swift sent her a beautiful bouquet of flowers along with a cute cardigan after the release of 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The daytime talk show host expressed her admiration, saying, “I love how kind she is.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-does-taylor-swift-gift-flower-to-kelly-clarkson-after-a-new-release>Why Does Taylor Swift Gift Flower to Kelly Clarkson After a New Release?</h2><p>The exchange of flowers has become somewhat of a tradition between the two artists. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swift</a> apparently vows to send them to Clarkson “every time I release something.” This act of friendship has piqued the interest of fans, making them appreciate the camaraderie between these two talented musicians.</p><p>The backstory to this floral tradition dates back to a tweet Clarkson posted in 2019. At that time, news broke that Scooter Braun’s company had acquired Swift’s former label. This meant that they gained control of the masters for her first six studio albums.</p><p>Feeling that Swift should have the opportunity to own her music, Clarkson suggested that re-recording the songs could be a solution. Despite the suggestion leading to flowers becoming a regular gift, Clarkson humbly insists that Swift would have likely thought of the idea herself.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> spoke highly of Swift’s business acumen, describing her as a “very smart businesswoman.” Despite the challenges Swift faced with the ownership of her music catalog, she successfully re-recorded and released her albums. This includes her most recent release, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), which enjoyed significant success on the Billboard charts.</p><p>Despite recent comments that sparked some media attention, Clarkson and Swift’s friendship remains unshaken. The “Since U Been Gone” singer clarified her remarks about Swift’s rumored romance with NFL player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce</a>. Although it may have seemed like she was shading Swift, she didn’t mean it that way. On Instagram, she emphasized that she didn’t intend to criticize their relationship.</p><p>Clarkson dismissed any notion of negativity and asserted her desire to focus on the game when tuning in to watch football.</p><p>Meanwhile, Swift is back on tour with the Eras Tour, delighting fans in Argentina. Over the weekend, Kelce was spotted at one of her concerts. An insanely viral clip show’s Swift changing the lyrics in “Karma” to talk about her romance with the Kansas City Chiefs player.</p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs tight end has previously commented on the excessive coverage of his relationship with Swift during NFL games, suggesting that the media might be “overdoing it.” Despite the playful banter, the NFL defended its coverage, citing the cultural intersection of sports and entertainment as a positive aspect that resonates with a wide audience.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_TravisBarker_Dave-Benett_Getty-Images-for-Selfridges-220x147.jpg alt="Fans Are Shading Travis Barker For Drumming His Newborn Baby’s Heartbeat in The Delivery Room" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKydnpnAbrLLqK6eqqNiwbB5yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdllauys8XToqSeZaOdsm6%2BxKWcmquVmXqiedGeZKudk6S%2FpbHDZpilmqWieqmx0Z6qZq%2BYrnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
