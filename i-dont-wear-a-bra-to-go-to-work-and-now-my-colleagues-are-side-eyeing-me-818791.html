Join&nbsp;us as&nbsp;we&nbsp;navigate the complex interplay between personal expression and professional expectations in&nbsp;the modern workplace.</p><h2>One woman shared her side of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>.</h2><p>This is&nbsp;easily the most absurd controversy that&nbsp;I have been involved&nbsp;in, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.</p><p>Day 1&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;new job. I&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;sweater and pants to&nbsp;work. I&nbsp;do not wear a&nbsp;bra. I&nbsp;have never worn a&nbsp;bra for two years at&nbsp;my&nbsp;previous job, and nobody has ever brought it&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;hate bras, I&nbsp;find them very uncomfortable and unnecessary.</p><p>Two people come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;during the day, and say that what I’m wearing is&nbsp;inappropriate and that&nbsp;I should wear a&nbsp;bra to&nbsp;work. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new job, I&nbsp;don’t even know any of&nbsp;these people. I’m literally wearing a&nbsp;sweater, you can’t see anything, I’m all covered&nbsp;up. (You can’t see anything except the shape of&nbsp;my&nbsp;boobs, I&nbsp;guess). One woman literally told me&nbsp;these words, as&nbsp;she was complaining about my&nbsp;clothes. I&nbsp;have large boobs, but&nbsp;I feel that what I’m wearing is&nbsp;completely normal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d1/b48/ce84d150ad83a3b4d2400788ff.jpg><p>Day 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;new job. I&nbsp;do not wear a&nbsp;bra, but&nbsp;I wear a&nbsp;T-shirt and a&nbsp;jacket on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that. I&nbsp;am dressed even more conservatively than on&nbsp;day 1. Two more people give me&nbsp;similar criticisms again.</p><p>One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;the secretary of&nbsp;my&nbsp;supervisor, so&nbsp;this is&nbsp;getting serious. I&nbsp;mention to&nbsp;her that the office literally has no&nbsp;<a href=# title="dress code" data-link=tag>dress code</a> and that employees can wear what is&nbsp;comfortable. She says that there is&nbsp;still an&nbsp;unspoken <a href=# title=etiquette data-link=tag>etiquette</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;followed. She also mentioned that the shape of&nbsp;my&nbsp;boobs was clearly visible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a52/c11/76162a598da6cdd7bfa3ef3c0a.jpg><p>The women that didnt invite her step dad to her wedding</p><p>For the two years&nbsp;I spent at&nbsp;my&nbsp;previous office, I&nbsp;did not wear a&nbsp;bra once. I&nbsp;usually wore sweaters or&nbsp;t-shirts or&nbsp;blouses, most of&nbsp;the time, along with a&nbsp;jacket. Even though&nbsp;I may have large breasts, I&nbsp;did not see it&nbsp;as&nbsp;inappropriate or&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong here?</p><p><h2>People were divided on&nbsp;their opinions.</h2></p><ul><li>“The real question is&nbsp;whether this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hill that you want to&nbsp;die&nbsp;on. Bras are a&nbsp;pretty standard attire requirement, reasonable for not. As&nbsp;the new person in&nbsp;the office, you do&nbsp;not have the credibility to&nbsp;push back on&nbsp;that expectation without serious career repercussions. If&nbsp;people notice you are not wearing a&nbsp;bra, something about your outfit is&nbsp;off.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Veroul&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;am afraid that even if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not see it&nbsp;as&nbsp;inappropriate, your new workplace does. To&nbsp;the extent that 4&nbsp;people over 2&nbsp;days have said something to&nbsp;you. That was your supervisor sending a&nbsp;message via the secretary, by&nbsp;the way. You will get fired or&nbsp;let go&nbsp;if&nbsp;you continue to&nbsp;not wear something. Can you wear a&nbsp;bralette, crop top bra, comfort bra/sleep bra, or&nbsp;similar?” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>firefly232&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“We&nbsp;just aren’t there yet. We&nbsp;keep fighting, but we&nbsp;gotta pay bills too. If&nbsp;that many people notice&nbsp;it, bite the bullet.<br>Unpopular opinion&nbsp;— you deserve to&nbsp;be&nbsp;comfortable, but not at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;those you work with. Not for this. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;wearing pants that show his package, I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;comfortable and if&nbsp;I complained as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, guarantee he’d have to&nbsp;change his manner of&nbsp;dress.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BulkyInformation2&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc6/d9d/864a225eeab0d194395d6aa5e6.jpg><ul><li>“Women’s breasts should be&nbsp;normalized, but society isn’t there yet, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually very noticeable. Overall, I’m saying you’re not wrong because it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;normal, but&nbsp;I understand it&nbsp;making people uncomfortable because it’s not yet. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;were you, I&nbsp;would wear sports bras/bralettes/camis just to&nbsp;keep the peace since it’s a&nbsp;new workplace, and you don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;starting off on&nbsp;the wrong foot.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heathahR&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;dress code, do&nbsp;what you want, but also it’s in&nbsp;their rights to&nbsp;want a&nbsp;certain level of&nbsp;professionalism.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chaliskis&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s ridiculous that people are this upset over your boobs and how you choose to&nbsp;dress when there’s not even a&nbsp;dress code.

If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;against that norm, you do&nbsp;you, but if&nbsp;you have anything but A-cup breasts, people are gonna notice.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>NYCQuilts&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>The decision to&nbsp;forgo a&nbsp;bra in&nbsp;the <a href=#>workplace</a> sheds light on&nbsp;broader discussions surrounding individual autonomy and societal expectations. While some may view it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;small act of&nbsp;rebellion, it&nbsp;serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;the ongoing struggle for acceptance and inclusivity in&nbsp;professional settings. It’s essential to&nbsp;continue challenging norms that limit personal expression and embrace diversity in&nbsp;all its forms. By&nbsp;fostering environments where individuals feel empowered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their authentic selves, we&nbsp;can create more inclusive and supportive workplaces for everyone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusM6nq2avlZa%2Fbq2Mm6maZaSkeqi7jK2mZq%2Bfp7hurc2dZKenp2K6unnCqKOlnZGcwqa%2FjJqpnmWjnrGmecSynKKml2K6pnmXam9wcWFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
