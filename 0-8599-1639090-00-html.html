"You call an animator a real director?" And with his dying breath, Jimmy whispers, "Yes, I do."</p><p>I'm with Jimmy. I grew up on animation, I respect the medium's artistry and dote on its jokes. This week, while on vacation, I watched a few animated films: the Pixar movie <i>Ratatouille</i>, which opened yesterday in nearly 4,000 North American theaters; the Japanese science-fiction epic <i>Paprika</i>, now playing in 20 major cities; <i>Aachi & Ssipak</i>, which is playing <a href=#>at the New York Asian Film Festival</a>; <i>Queer Duck: The Movie</i>, the tres gay comedy that's available on DVD; and for old times' sake, this year's Oscar-winning, made-in-Australia animated feature <i>Happy Feet</i>.</p><p>Some of these movies (<i>Rat, Feet</i>) I loved; some (<i>Paprika, Aachi</i>) I studied with a cooler, appraisal admiration; and <i>Queer Duck</i> I thought just silly, sublimely so. But often, as I watched, I wondered: Why can't the makers of live-action films take one-tenth the care these guys did? Why are so many animated features bursting with wild imagination, coherent characters, glorious visualizing 혰 all we should expect from film 혰 and "real" movies aren't?</p><p>Vladimir Nabokov wrote that reality is "one of the few words which mean nothing without quotes." The same with calling live-action films real movies. I watch these things for a living, and it's a great job, but any critic knows that the average film is basically photographs of people talking, walking or hitting something. The process is pretty simple: actors pretend to be real people; they get their pictures taken while they say their lines a few times; and later, watching the assembly of these scenes in a theater or at home, you laugh, cry or shrug.</p><p>Animated features 혰 cartoons, to the less respectful 혰 can provide, for a start, just about everything a live-action film does. You already know how George Miller's <i>Happy Feet</i> matches music and story, political message with emotional heft. But can animation deliver persuasive action and ultra-violence? Sure. Jo Beom-jin's <i>Aachi & Ssipak</i> unloads more artillery than were fired in three hours of the Pacino <i>Scarface</i>, and with fewer moral scruples; and its climactic chase, inspired by the runaway-cart scene inside the mountain at the end of <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>, tops that Spielberg spectacle for sheer stunt ingenuity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6PBprrTZ6uipZVjsLC5jq2gpp1flr%2B1v46aqa2hk6GycHyLcWxycVxmg3SFj3JnZWhgY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
