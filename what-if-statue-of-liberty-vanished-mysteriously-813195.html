Ah, the Big Apple. The city where more than 8&nbsp;million people live. The home of&nbsp;Broadway, the Empire State Building, Central Park, and the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. Now, Lady Liberty came to&nbsp;the United States from <a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a> back in&nbsp;<strong>1885</strong>, in&nbsp;over <strong>300 </strong>copper pieces. She came with instructions: “Some assembly required. Batteries not included”. She was a&nbsp;gift from the French people to&nbsp;the Americans. But the receiving party had to&nbsp;prepare the pedestal for her themselves. Hmm.</p><p>Instead of&nbsp;New York, the Statue could’ve ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston</strong> or&nbsp;even <strong>San Francisco</strong>. All of&nbsp;these cities were willing to&nbsp;pay for the construction if&nbsp;they got the Statue. But New Yorkers wanted&nbsp;it, too. They started the fundraising campaign and managed to&nbsp;get all the money needed. So, the Statue officially called New York home in&nbsp;1886, where it&nbsp;still resides. Sorry, Philly. I&nbsp;like your cheesesteaks, though. Anyway, the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was my&nbsp;first stop, and&nbsp;I was very excited. But I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea what was to&nbsp;come next.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a91/e1d/04438b5756b15c5da0f865a1f3.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;1. </strong>I&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;New York City,<strong> </strong>and first thing, I&nbsp;took the ferry to&nbsp;Liberty Island. I&nbsp;could see her already, far away in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the Harbor. As&nbsp;the ferry approached the statue, all the people started to&nbsp;take pictures with her. I&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;exception. I&nbsp;asked someone to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;me, turned away from the Statue, looked into the camera, and smiled. But the guy looked shocked. I&nbsp;asked him what was wrong, but he&nbsp;couldn’t say anything. He&nbsp;just pointed to&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. Well, to&nbsp;where it&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Because the Statue was just gone. He&nbsp;said it&nbsp;was there, but the next second, it&nbsp;just disappeared. Other people saw that too and started to&nbsp;ask each other what happened. But no&nbsp;one had any idea. Still, we&nbsp;reached the dock and got out of&nbsp;the ferry. It&nbsp;felt like it&nbsp;was just some trick, but apparently, it&nbsp;wasn’t. The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was really gone, and its pedestal was totally empty. Of&nbsp;course, there were some people who climbed up&nbsp;on&nbsp;it&nbsp;pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty themselves and taking photos.</p><p>Very soon, authorities arrived and didn’t let anyone leave the island. They said they wanted to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;investigation and catch the thief since the thief should still be&nbsp;there on&nbsp;an&nbsp;island. As&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s actually possible to&nbsp;steal the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. They interrogated every single person on&nbsp;the island. We&nbsp;spent the whole day there, and in&nbsp;the end, they had to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us go. Who had the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty hidden in&nbsp;their pockets? What a&nbsp;surprise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/894/0ef/99f2a8584d8a506cc67aebbc41.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;2. </strong>That was one crazy case, so&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;stick around in&nbsp;New York for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;watch how the situation would progress. Of&nbsp;course, in&nbsp;the morning, it’s in&nbsp;all the newspapers, magazines, and on&nbsp;TV talk shows. All the Times Square banners are showing photos of&nbsp;the Statue with the headings “<strong>Have you seen&nbsp;me?</strong>”, “<strong>The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty is&nbsp;gone!</strong>” and even dramatic ones like “<strong>The theft of&nbsp;the century:</strong> the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty is&nbsp;<strong>stolen</strong>”. Well, the whole Big Apple is&nbsp;mourning the loss. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crazy number of&nbsp;people colored blue-green, like the patina on&nbsp;the statue, wearing dresses and the souvenir foam crown of&nbsp;Miss Liberty.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, all the local souvenir stores ran out of&nbsp;those, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;of&nbsp;all the little plastic statues of&nbsp;liberty, too. I’m trying to&nbsp;avoid Instagram or&nbsp;any other social networks. Every celebrity and every single user posts pictures of&nbsp;the Statue with a&nbsp;crying emoji and a&nbsp;broken heart. The Internet turned into one big memorial.<br>In&nbsp;the evening, the Empire State Building is&nbsp;shining blue-green in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;the missing statue.</p><p><strong>Day&nbsp;5. </strong>New York City is&nbsp;even more crowded now. It&nbsp;seems like all of&nbsp;America came to&nbsp;the city to&nbsp;make sure that the statue is&nbsp;actually gone, and it’s not some Internet hoax. Like we&nbsp;need another one of&nbsp;those. Now, the edge of&nbsp;Manhattan from where the ferry used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Liberty Island is&nbsp;overcrowded. There’re many super loyal fans colored in&nbsp;blue-green (who honestly freak me&nbsp;out a&nbsp;bit) who are staying there all day long, waiting for the Statue&nbsp;to, somehow, come back. No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Liberty Island. All the best detectives in&nbsp;the world arrived there to&nbsp;investigate this case, trying to&nbsp;figure out what could’ve happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/540/5d0/c17ae1530bb5d327f54562abd7.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;10. </strong>France officially announced that they’ll make a&nbsp;new Statue of&nbsp;Liberty for New York. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;super nice of&nbsp;them, but people keep crying, saying that no&nbsp;new Statue of&nbsp;Liberty can replace the original one, so&nbsp;dearly loved. Do&nbsp;you remember that back in&nbsp;1885, there were other cities like Boston and Philadelphia that wanted to&nbsp;get the Statue? Well, now they’re blaming New York for losing a&nbsp;<strong>151&nbsp;ft (46&nbsp;m)</strong> high statue weighing <strong>450,000&nbsp;lb (204,000&nbsp;kg)</strong>, claiming it&nbsp;would’ve never happened had the Statue been set in&nbsp;Boston (or&nbsp;Philly). Which honestly sounds absurd.</p><p>Also, did you know that there’re more Statues of&nbsp;Liberty in&nbsp;the world? There’s a&nbsp;smaller version of&nbsp;it, which was given by&nbsp;the&nbsp;US citizens to&nbsp;France a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years after the original one was set in&nbsp;New York. This little monument, just <strong>37&nbsp;ft (11&nbsp;m)​​​​​​​</strong> high, has been standing near the Grenelle Bridge in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>. Well, until a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days ago. To&nbsp;comfort the Americans, France transported the little copy from Paris to&nbsp;New York, and they put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the pedestal instead of&nbsp;the one that was gone.</p><p>Well, given that this one is&nbsp;more than 10&nbsp;times smaller than the original, it&nbsp;looks a&nbsp;bit... funny. But I&nbsp;guess New Yorkers can’t imagine New York without one, even if&nbsp;it’s just a&nbsp;replica. Also, there’s a&nbsp;life-sized copy of&nbsp;Lady Liberty’s torch standing in&nbsp;Paris. Well, that one was also transported to&nbsp;New York and set on&nbsp;Liberty Island as&nbsp;a&nbsp;monument. Meanwhile, the folks in&nbsp;Las Vegas at&nbsp;the New York Casino and Hotel are staying awfully quiet for some reason, trying to&nbsp;stay under the radar about that statue ruckus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5e7/7a9/06905a51c6bca718cfdd6f30d7.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;20. </strong>The world started a&nbsp;huge fundraising campaign to&nbsp;raise money for the new Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. And then it&nbsp;ended. It&nbsp;took just 2&nbsp;hours and 47&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;raise all the $100,000,000 that was needed. Almost 2&nbsp;billion people from nearly every single country in&nbsp;the world donated. The construction is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;start in&nbsp;two weeks in&nbsp;Paris, France, just like in&nbsp;the good old times. And then, it’ll be&nbsp;transported to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US again.</p><p>Boston is&nbsp;still trying to&nbsp;insist that we&nbsp;shouldn’t trust New York with the Statue anymore. But I&nbsp;don’t think they’ll manage to&nbsp;persuade the world, because this little replica on&nbsp;the pedestal still looks funny. I’ll never get used to&nbsp;it. Also, starting today, tourists are allowed to&nbsp;travel to&nbsp;Liberty Island for the first time since the incident. It&nbsp;seems like all of&nbsp;New York wants to&nbsp;visit the island now, so&nbsp;the authorities had to&nbsp;go<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with the digital queue.</p><p>All the tickets for the next two months are already booked, and it&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;less than ten minutes. Well, given the <strong>8&nbsp;million New Yorkers</strong> and more than <strong>250 million tourists</strong> New York City welcomes every year, I&nbsp;think I’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;visit the island about... next decade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c9f/484/938893536492dccbbf149d44d9.png><p><strong>Day&nbsp;31. </strong>Crazy news. Can’t believe&nbsp;it. The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty&nbsp;— and&nbsp;I mean the original one&nbsp;— is&nbsp;back. They say it&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night. The smaller replica is&nbsp;now standing next to&nbsp;the pedestal, and the original Lady Liberty is&nbsp;in&nbsp;its rightful place. I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;see&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;I rushed to&nbsp;the Harbor. Just like everyone in&nbsp;New York. It&nbsp;actually is&nbsp;back. No&nbsp;one still knows what happened. The great minds of&nbsp;the world still can’t solve the mystery. David Copperfield has an&nbsp;air-tight alibi. But if&nbsp;you ask&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;think that the Statue just left by&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Maybe it&nbsp;just needed a&nbsp;vacation. I&nbsp;can picture it&nbsp;chilling on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach in&nbsp;Central America. Can’t blame&nbsp;it. Standing there for more than a&nbsp;hundred years without a&nbsp;single day off, always being patient with all the people constantly taking pictures of&nbsp;you. That’s not an&nbsp;easy job. I’m glad it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;little vacation. Maybe we&nbsp;won’t lose it&nbsp;for another 15&nbsp;decades. Hey, we&nbsp;were all worried, and she’s standing there like nothing happened. “Chill out, people. I’m back.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lo6mutcHEZqafZZyer6a%2B07Jkr5mensCpscNmpLKrpJq%2FqrvUrKOyZWhmgHKFlGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
