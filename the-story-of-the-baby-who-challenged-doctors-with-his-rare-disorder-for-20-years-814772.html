Doctors were super surprised by&nbsp;how Tomm Tennent looked when he&nbsp;was born. Tomm’s dad couldn’t believe it&nbsp;either. Their journey since then has been full of&nbsp;tough moments and strong feelings. Now, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;fast-forward to&nbsp;our days, seeing how Tomm looks now might just make you cry in&nbsp;amazement.</p><p><h2>Meet Tomm Tennent and his special case.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/487/f57/6938f6585b8bc857b2fbcd2a7f.png><p>Back in&nbsp;1993, down in&nbsp;South East <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>, something really unusual happened. A&nbsp;baby named Tomm Tennent was born with a&nbsp;special condition that surprised everyone. Before he&nbsp;was born, ultrasounds already hinted at&nbsp;something very unusual, making his parents question about keeping him or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Fortunately, Tomm’s father decided well. “We&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;discussed this between&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;decided what’s meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;is&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;be, and we&nbsp;went through with&nbsp;it,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said his dad</a>, Geoff Tennent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17c/39f/f7967052bea34cbf59b86bc932.jpg><p>No&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;tests or&nbsp;check-ups could have possibly gotten someone ready for just how serious Tomm’s condition was. When his parents saw him for the very first time in&nbsp;the delivery room, they were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>completely taken aback</a>. Tomm’s mom, Debbie Tennent, couldn’t trust her own eyes when they put him on&nbsp;her chest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba1/96b/3166035a3895e2330dfafdcd56.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;heart came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;throat, but at&nbsp;the same time, it&nbsp;was lovely to&nbsp;pick him up&nbsp;and cuddle him,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she said</a>. Doctors were confused by&nbsp;Tomm.</p><p>Since the cause was unclear, there was no&nbsp;available treatment or&nbsp;solution. Their only hope was that as&nbsp;he&nbsp;aged, he&nbsp;would naturally grow into his skin, and the wrinkles would lessen.</p><p><h2>Researchers finally made a&nbsp;fascinating discovery about his condition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c5/45c/7915fd5b5a9324bd7f6491593d.jpg><p>He&nbsp;stayed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital for about two and a&nbsp;half months, which was quite a&nbsp;challenging time for the researchers.</p><p>They discovered that Tomm has a&nbsp;Hyaluronic acid surplus in&nbsp;his body, like the Shar Pei puppies. But his levels of&nbsp;this substance were way higher than what’s normal. Interestingly, as&nbsp;Shar Peis grow, their levels of&nbsp;this substance go&nbsp;down, and their skin changes. Doctors believed that the same might happen to&nbsp;Tomm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7a9/d55/75654f5e5cac3e60afc44cf38d.png><p>Dr. Andrew Ramsden, a&nbsp;doctor, said that Tomm’s condition would probably get better as&nbsp;he&nbsp;grew older. He&nbsp;was right! Tomm’s condition did improve with time, just as&nbsp;the doctor thought it&nbsp;would.</p><p>Tomm faced challenges in&nbsp;his early years, experiencing teasing and being left out of&nbsp;school because of&nbsp;his distinct appearance. Although he&nbsp;still had some minor physical distinctions, they were less<br>prominent compared to&nbsp;when he&nbsp;was born.</p><p><h2>Meet him today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb9/17e/cd8d56520aaf61c8c374ecc7b3.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/370/2a2/3e23cd57c0a42ca6462a537a29.jpg><p>It&nbsp;has been 30&nbsp;years since Tomm’s birth, astounding doctors. We&nbsp;don’t know much about him from social media and Tomm’s current life is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mystery.</p><p>On&nbsp;his <a href=# title=Facebook data-link=tag>Facebook</a>, it&nbsp;looks like he’s happily married to&nbsp;Hannah in&nbsp;a&nbsp;place called Frankston, down in&nbsp;Victoria, Australia. “Life’s simple. You make choices, and you don’t look back,” Tomm posted on&nbsp;his Facebook profile.</p><p>A&nbsp;new baby coming into the world is&nbsp;a&nbsp;joyful event, but it&nbsp;also comes with an&nbsp;innate sense of&nbsp;protection toward the new arrival. The main characters in&nbsp;our next story, Cristina and Blaize, were overjoyed to&nbsp;see their newborn daughter, but they soon learned she had a&nbsp;<a href=#>rare condition</a> that initially baffled doctors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nToZxmmpGXxm7Dx6hknKCRobmmusaem2acn5jBsL7SZq6irJhitaq%2FjKuYq51dmba0u9GdnKtllqS%2Fbn6PZrCemaKoenl9k3Bua2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
