Never giving up&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crucial rule. Being fired can become a&nbsp;new and better page in&nbsp;your life and some celebrities have proven this with their own example.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong> were excited to&nbsp;learn about these celebrity success stories and would like to&nbsp;share their experience of&nbsp;being fired with you.</p><p><h2>1. Madonna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c25/a11/3d76b5512e8df94af8dbb6bbd5.jpg><p>Before <a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a> became a&nbsp;legendary singer she used to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;Dunkin’ Donuts. She only lasted for about a&nbsp;week there and <a href=#>confessed</a> that people there were “pissed off” because she wasn’t taking her job seriously: “<strong>I&nbsp;was playing with the jelly squirter machine.</strong>”</p><p><h2>2. Ellen DeGeneres</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b16/75c/027e8451639f91f935c87daa83.jpg><p>Once, Ellen gave a&nbsp;speech about civilian rights and <a href=#>opened</a> up&nbsp;that she was fired because of&nbsp;her preferences in&nbsp;her personal life: “I&nbsp;was fired for being gay, and&nbsp;<strong>I know what it&nbsp;feels like. I&nbsp;lost everything</strong>, but look at&nbsp;me&nbsp;now.”</p><p>Now she can bring in&nbsp;$7&nbsp;million in&nbsp;profit and make the world a&nbsp;better place.</p><p><h2>3. Anna Wintour</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0f/ae0/51a46d593197a6268d140cdd63.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;look at&nbsp;this woman, we&nbsp;can’t imagine how someone could’ve fired her in&nbsp;the past. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>, Wintour confirmed that she was fired as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stylist: “Totally I&nbsp;was fired. <strong>I&nbsp;was told&nbsp;I would never understand the American market</strong>. I&nbsp;think everyone should be&nbsp;fired. It’s character-building.”</p><p>Now Anna Wintour is&nbsp;the most influential person in&nbsp;fashion.</p><p><h2>4. Oprah Winfrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d05/572/c801935f1bb200e22069c4c3ec.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>1976</a>, Oprah moved to&nbsp;Baltimore and started working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;anchorwoman. But something went wrong and she was <a href=#>fired</a>: “Every time being demoted is&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity for something else.<strong> I&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;good television reporter. I&nbsp;was too emotional</strong>.”</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, she was earning $22,000&nbsp;a year but by&nbsp;2008, her annual income had increased to&nbsp;$275&nbsp;<a href=#>million</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Nicki Minaj</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5b/05d/ed9c625d618d11f3781be82e2f.jpg><p>Before Nicki Minaj became a&nbsp;celebrity she couldn’t hold down any job. She <a href=#>says</a> that she was so&nbsp;bad. The last job that she had was as&nbsp;an&nbsp;office manager and she says she hated going to&nbsp;<a href=#>work</a>: “I’d been fired like 15&nbsp;times because&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;horrible attitude. I&nbsp;worked at&nbsp;Red Lobster before that and<strong>&nbsp;I chased a&nbsp;customer out of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=restaurant data-link=tag>restaurant</a> once so&nbsp;she’d give me&nbsp;my&nbsp;pen back</strong>.”</p><p><h2>6. Janelle Monáe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b77/5af/7b9dc752d3bd1b2a120941b43c.jpg><p>Janelle Monáe shared a&nbsp;very interesting story that many people can relate&nbsp;to. She was working at&nbsp;Office Depot. At&nbsp;that time, she lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;boarding house with 6&nbsp;other girls because renting her own apartment was too expensive. Once, her boss called her and <a href=#>said</a>: “Listen, we’re gonna make this easy for you: <strong>You’re fired. Go&nbsp;do&nbsp;what you love.</strong> You don’t wanna be&nbsp;here.”</p><p>She is&nbsp;happy that she got a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;be&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;what she loved.</p><p><h2>7. Chelsea Handler</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bcc/449/9d200c5372a84482af4ea6d736.jpg><p>Nowadays, Chelsea Handler is&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful comedian, actress, and writer but<strong> she has been fired from every job she had before becoming famous</strong>. One time, she was a&nbsp;<a href=#>waitress</a>: “I&nbsp;once waited on&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;10&nbsp;people, and one guy collected the money from the check and tipped me&nbsp;$20&nbsp;on $600.” Chelsea got mad and insulted him: “That was my&nbsp;last waitressing job.”</p><p><h2>8. Amy Adams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98e/5e9/dfaf785b33ab5a90db456e972a.jpg><p>Amy Adams was <strong>fired from a&nbsp;television show because they thought she wasn’t attractive enough</strong>: " So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was really <a href=#>thinking</a>&nbsp;I wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;doing this anymore. I&nbsp;thought the industry was telling me&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t going to&nbsp;happen."</p><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;can see now, she became a&nbsp;popular actress and many people recognize her all over the world.</p><p><h2>9. Lady Gaga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d30/676/a8e9595f5093adfceafc746ae0.jpg><p><a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a> was <strong><a href=#>fired</a> from her first record label </strong>which didn’t want to&nbsp;wait another 6&nbsp;months for her to&nbsp;create her debut album. And it&nbsp;was the darkest days of&nbsp;her life. She <a href=#>says</a> that not giving up&nbsp;is&nbsp;very important after these things in&nbsp;the entertainment field.</p><p><h2>10. Hugh Jackman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f56/909/bdc1fd550bba060cbdcf14d20b.jpg><p>The first real job <a href=# title="Hugh Jackman" data-link=tag>Hugh Jackman</a> had was working at&nbsp;the nearby 7-Eleven. His manager fired him for being a&nbsp;<a href=#>chatterbox</a>: “<strong>I&nbsp;talked too much to&nbsp;the customers</strong>, which was probably true.”</p><p>Even though he&nbsp;got fired, he&nbsp;accepts that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;positive experience and that there are many other ways to&nbsp;earn money.</p><p>Have you ever been fired?
