Their divorce got messier and messier, and Kelly has revealed the harsh comment her husband made on&nbsp;her body and how she dealt with&nbsp;it. Fans have also noticed the American Idol winner appears to&nbsp;have <a href=# title="lost weight" data-link=tag>lost weight</a> and the singer is&nbsp;sharing her secrets.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;bitter divorce and Kelly’s legal victory.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/794/729/1a92205db0bb99fd0f72a34b5d.jpg><p>GilbertFlores@Broadimage/Broad Image/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;legal victory that reverberated through celebrity circles, Kelly Clarkson secured a&nbsp;significant triumph against Brandon Blackstock. Their seven-year marriage, which ended in&nbsp;2020, brought to&nbsp;light allegations of&nbsp;Brandon unlawfully securing contracts on&nbsp;Kelly’s behalf. Managing her professional career during their marriage, he&nbsp;ventured into securing deals for <i>The Voice</i>, <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Wayfair, and the Billboard Music Awards.</p><p>He&nbsp;was asked to&nbsp;repay a&nbsp;staggering <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$2,641,374</a> in&nbsp;commission to&nbsp;her. A&nbsp;bitter custody dispute arose over their children, nine-year-old River Rose and seven-year-old Remington “Remy” Alexander. Their shared Montana ranch too was fought over. The couple now has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joint</a> custody of&nbsp;their two kids.</p><p><h2>Her then-husband also made a&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;her body.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac2/ec7/5d9d4a5803b5f084bce441b7ec.jpg><p>Kelly confided in&nbsp;her then-husband and manager Brandon, telling him that she’s been wanting to&nbsp;join <i>The Voice</i>’s panel. She reveals that she said this to&nbsp;him for years, but he&nbsp;discouraged her. He&nbsp;told her that the executives were looking for someone sexy, like <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a>, and wouldn’t be&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;her. He&nbsp;also added that the executives wanted diversity, and she was too similar to&nbsp;Blake Shelton.</p><p>Kelly eventually joined <i>The Voice</i> years later, but her husband’s comment stayed with her. “... a&nbsp;wife doesn’t forget a&nbsp;time she gets told she’s not a&nbsp;sex symbol, so&nbsp;that stays,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>, recalling the incident.</p><p><h2>Kelly began focusing on&nbsp;herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a4/534/4f275e5e71b5bcaed1b5d45d9f.jpg><p>Away from the legal drama, Kelly Clarkson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> insights into her remarkable weight loss journey. Embracing a&nbsp;healthier lifestyle, she attributes her transformation to&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;<a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a> and exercise. The singer, now residing in&nbsp;New York City, credits walking in&nbsp;the city as&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant workout. Delving into wellness practices like infrared saunas and cold plunges, Clarkson emphasizes her commitment to&nbsp;holistic health.</p><p>As&nbsp;for diet, according to&nbsp;the singer, she doesn’t do&nbsp;anything extreme. Clarkson details her dietary choices, describing a&nbsp;healthy mix focusing on&nbsp;protein. Acknowledging her Texas roots and love for meat, she humorously apologizes to&nbsp;vegetarians.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;diet and workout, Kelly credits her weight loss to&nbsp;her doctor. She reveals she started listening to&nbsp;her doctor’s advice and that’s ultimately what helped her lose weight. Kelly had issues with weight loss in&nbsp;the past. She struggled with thyroid and autoimmune conditions that prevented her from losing weight. She followed a&nbsp;diet that addressed those issues.</p><p><h2>Her empowering perspective on&nbsp;body image.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e9/5fb/fcdc7c545090819b5b93632437.jpg><p>Clarkson’s journey in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> hasn’t been without its share of&nbsp;body image commentary. The original “American Idol” opens up&nbsp;about industry pressures and how she gained her coaching role on&nbsp;<i>The Voice</i> after embracing her authentic self. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant statement, she stresses the importance of&nbsp;artists challenging societal norms, asserting that personality and authenticity should triumph over superficial expectations.</p><p>“I&nbsp;got on&nbsp;the No.&nbsp;1&nbsp;television show at&nbsp;my&nbsp;heaviest point, because it&nbsp;was right after&nbsp;I had kids, and it&nbsp;was like they didn’t care...It had nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with my&nbsp;sex appeal or&nbsp;my&nbsp;look aesthetically. It&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with me&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. I&nbsp;think it’s really up&nbsp;to&nbsp;artists to&nbsp;force people to&nbsp;have that mentality.”</p><p>Kelly still <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>splurges</a> on&nbsp;desserts of&nbsp;her choice whenever she feels like&nbsp;it. She is&nbsp;enjoying her single life and doesn’t want to&nbsp;get married ever again.
