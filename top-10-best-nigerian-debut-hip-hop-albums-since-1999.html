While speaking about his diamond-selling debut album, <strong>Country Grammar</strong>, he said something along the lines of, 'You have your whole life to make your debut album, that's why sophomore albums make artists nervous.'</p><p>Whatever the case might be, quality debut albums need appreciation - especially in Nigerian Hip-Hop. Here are our choices of the 10 best debut albums in Nigerian Hip-Hop since 1999.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>10) Album: Pirated Copy</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d304c37f-c1e0-4ed9-a7e4-12af89263d2b data-caption="2Shotz - Pirated Copy.

It might not be <strong>2Shotz</strong>'s best album, but it's good enough.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>9) Album: African American</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-64b63737-cc61-4908-be35-c1a402acbf06 data-caption="Sinzu - African American.

The first half of the album is made up of pop records and the second half is made up of grimy Hip-Hop beats that the Nigerian Hip-Hop community could not relate with.</p><p>Nonetheless, it gave <strong>Sinzu </strong>the confidence to be Nigeria's best rapper in 2011 and parts of 2012.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-29>8.)

But guys, when it dropped <strong>Ice Prince </strong>got a bloodbath from Hip-Hop head son Twitter NG. They hated his rap technique and delivery. They failed to understand that there are different ways to make rap music. These Hip-Hop heads particularly hated the commercial drive of <strong>Everybody Loves Ice Prince.</strong></p><p>But here's the truth; this is an amazing album that's aging like fine wine.

Guys,his brother was a student at Yaba College of Technology when this album was made. Word on the street is that <strong>Gino </strong>and his brothers were the first to have a home studio amongst the underground rappers in Lagos.</p><p>This album was not special for just its bars, it was about the production of a young <strong>Sossick. </strong>Who at the time was a rapper-turned-producer.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-79>4.)

On 'Ehen,' his dissed <strong>Rasqie, Eedris, The Remedies, Maintain </strong>and more. On 'Big Bros,' he took aim at <strong>Kenny Ogungbe </strong>and <strong>Dayo Adeneye </strong>of <strong>Kennis Music. </strong>This came after he got a piece of advise from <strong>Paul Play Dairo </strong>who told him to mix his mother tongue and pidgin for effective Nigerian rap music.</p><p><strong>Ruggedman </strong>added his own twist and floored everybody with commercial music which earned criticism from Nigerian Hip-Hop circles. They felt he 'sold out.' In truth, this was a turning point for Nigerian Hip-Hop. This was a man who fearlessly went against the Hip-Hop stereotype to facilitate relatable Hip-Hop records for everybody and got acclaim and awards for it.</p><p>In the same vein, it also earned him a 'Death Blow.'</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-93>3.)

At helm of affairs was <strong>Major Banggz </strong>while Phyno was<strong> </strong>spat fire<strong>. </strong>If Nigeria will ever have its own brand of rap music, we have to go back to that sound or go a little forward to <strong>Young Jon</strong>’s serial madness on ‘Awon Goons Mi' and 'Cause Trouble.'</p><p>Phyno was the producer-turned-swashbuckiling Igbo-speaking rapper with an avant-garde appearance. On ‘Obago’ he rapped, “East coast n**a banging in the west” and it was a fact. ‘Ghost Mode,’ ‘Obago,’ ‘Parcel’ and ‘Kush Music’ were mega-hits before his album dropped. When the album dropped, ‘Alobam’ became a cultural moment.</p><p><strong>Phyno </strong>was the cool kid with the cool fashion sense. ‘Alobam’ birthed merchandize and street culture. If MI Abaga visibly merged rap with pop music, Phyno blurred the lines. This was a proper rap album with hits, critical acclaim and awards. ‘Parcel’ was rightly named Best Rap Single at the 2014 Headies.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The only reason this album didn’t win Album of the Year was probably because <strong>Baddest Guy Ever Liveth </strong>was in the same category.</p><p><strong>- Culled from Pulse Nigeria</strong></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-122>1.)

A lot of people tend to ask that question. Well, as former Senior Editor of <strong>Pulse Nigeria </strong>puts it, "The three greatest Nigerian rappers are Modenine, M.I, and Olamide. While Modenine is the bar for lyricism and Olamide is the greatest Nigerian rapper to impact pop culture, M.I has the strongest discography."</p><p><strong>MI Abaga </strong>was an English-speaking Nigerian rapper who transcended realms into hits and pop culture relevance. He also won awards that pop stars were winning. This album was an important moment that proved to Nigerian rappers that you can do it if you understand how to work with sound.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>- Culled from Pulse Nigeria</strong></p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-136>Honourable Mentions</h2></p><p><strong>Sasha - First Lady</strong></p><p><strong>Trybesmen - LAG Style</strong></p><p><strong>Knighthouse </strong>- <strong>Street Scriptures Vol 1</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2TBsLyMamdmmpWowW66yKCcq6GRo3qlscGuq2agmaV6qbvPZpilmqWiwG6%2FyKeanmVhboZ6e81taptuZKI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
