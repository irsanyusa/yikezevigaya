They know how to give you that thrill that borders on drug-induced ecstasy, and this is not just in a sexual context.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>An inconsistent partner could be the babe with whom conversations are effortless, with whom romance is unforced; with whom sex is always like well-rehearsed ballet – gliding beautifully from step to step, from blissful level unto the next until a perfect crescendo is breathlessly attained.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e72fd35c-4d19-460d-8abf-4245088d674d data-caption="When a man you have been dating feels uncomfortable meeting your family members, then you should have a rethink."><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/_26ktkqTURBXy80MTZhNTkzMDZiOWU1YmFlZjM3MGJjNTBhOTAyMzk5ZC5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQG8wsM></span><p>An inconsistent partner could be the guy who does these same things and more. He weaves his life around yours so delicately; drawing you in with a foretaste of everything you long for in a partner. He's the gentleman you want. He's the broad shoulders to cry on that you've always desired. He's the one whose face you see beside you when you imagine your <a href=# id=1b7666a3-8d79-45d5-8269-7ca3614c8b04>big, Nigerian wedding</a>. He's so sweet, so nice, so charming and so... everything.</p><p>But that only tells part of the story with such people.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>Eventual disappointment</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Whether it is with the inconsistent male or the female, what follows the gloriously affectionate moments are dreadful disappearing acts that leave you dumbfounded, starved, confused, crazy, empty and self-condemning.</p><p>Their attachment to you is in a way that makes it easy for them to untangle themselves after making you open up, trust, become tied to them, dependent on them for emotional balance and mindlessly slip into love with them.</p><p>“It is the most frustrating thing ever,” says <strong>Inem</strong>, a Lagosian who was in a relationship with an inconsistent partner for about a year.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-543e6839-1900-4ed3-b69a-72a24eb7a4d3 data-caption="Inconsistent partners are never good for long, or bad forever.

You know what is obtainable. You know the amount of sweetness that partner is capable of, you have seen and experienced in some measure, the levels of romantic completeness that can be attained with that person but there’s only so little of it being offered to you that it drives you so, so crazy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It’s like getting someone hooked on a drug and then depriving them of that drug. In this context, one of the withdrawal symptoms is frustration.</p><p>You cannot have them when you please. You only have them when they show up, and that is always at their discretion.</p><p>“I stayed too long in that relationship, I must say. But I knew I could no longer bear it when it was obvious I would never be able to depend on the guy.” says Inem.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7c226048-93cc-4a00-854d-9fe8418eca18 data-caption="They keep you waiting for so long, but Inconsistent partners always come back.. or at least, try to.

Most times, their reasons are really not reasons. They glorify excuses that could be overcome with a little effort – like being busy, or losing a phone, or not having credit and so on and so forth.</p><p>Because they know you so well and know all the buttons to push, you find yourself giving them one more chance. And after that yet another chance, and another and yet another. You know it is unlikely that they’ll do better as promised but they’ll sound so convincing that you find yourself allowing them back in, even as something in you screams.</p><p>“You fool!”</p><p>What this regular cycle of disappearance, repentance, and reappearance does is that your mind becomes messed up. It becomes so difficult to tell what is right and what is not.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-95582bf3-06d7-4997-877f-129fb08fd9c8 data-caption="I was ready to move on but then he showed up again... that's exactly how inconsistent partners make you feel.

He always came back with a different excuse all the time.” Inem says.</p><p>You find yourself wallowing in a pool of self-condemnation at some point. You wonder if you are too demanding, or whether you have too much of a chocking presence.</p><p>You’ll find yourself wondering if you are asking for too much, you’ll find yourself settling for more and more of their crap, losing self-respect just to get a little scraps of them because, somehow, regardless of their on-and-off nature, they manage to retain an incontestable ability power to feed your soul, excite your mind and set your body on fire. It’s such a crazy place to be.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>With different inconsistent partners, the pattern may have little variations but you can be sure that underwhelming moments of loneliness will be hot on the heels of divine, giddy moments of true romance.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-db858343-3b1e-4fa4-93aa-750048fc7b11 data-caption="It may hurt to let him or her go, but that is exactly what has to be done with an inconsistent partner if you value your peace of mind.
