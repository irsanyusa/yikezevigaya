The lift was two pounds more than the previous record, which was set by Bjrnssons rival <a href=# id=1a886874-d33f-32d6-ac74-e40418a1c1fc>Eddie Hall</a> in 2016.</p><p>In a post-lift interview, Bjrnsson called out Hall to a presumable boxing match, saying he signed a seven-figure fight contract with Core Sports and knows Hall was approached with the same offer. Thor called for him to sign the Core Sports contract and meet him in the ring.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Eddie, I know I just knocked out your record. And now Im ready to knock you out in the ring, Bjrnsson said in the interview. Time to put your fists where your big mouth is.</p><p>"I don't dislike Thor. I don't hate Thor. I've got no agenda to fight Thor, but I feel as though there is a demand there. I feel like the fans want to see it," he said, adding, "There's no hard feelings. Well be very gentlemanly about it. If he wants to take his time and train and set something up for 2021 maybe, then let's do it."</p><p>And it appears that timeline could be realistic, according to Thors post-game interview.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Im ready, Bjrnsson said, before asking, Are you ready, Eddie?</p><p>Call it a clash of the titans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLTAn6uhp6Jir6u70aeqrKeeYre2v9NmmqGZnKGyr7PEnWSenJSesm60wKWjZqyfYq5ussign61lkZvBpr6MrJ%2BarKSav6q6xmafoqtdmbKisMuina1nqZyEdq7Xpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
