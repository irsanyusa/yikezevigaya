He added that not only is he the person handling the bank account for <a href=# id=45ae9c02-cc05-48ae-97e2-f277f6f79ed0 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>his father's bills</a>, but he is also the actor's next of kin.</p><p>Daniel began, “My name is Daniel Okafor; I am John Okafor’s second son. There is no truth in what Stella Maris has been sharing online. Jasmine does not have access to that account; I have access to it. I am the signatory to the account and my father’s next of kin. She is my stepmother. My mother is not around at the moment."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-17ed6e3b-f0bd-44c4-93ba-ad917954b7b9 data-caption="Mr Ibu's wife Stella Maris, claimed that Jazmine is 'a stranger interfering with family matters'"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/WFpktkqTURBXy9mN2ViZjVjYmY3ZDIxNjg4NzIyYzdjZDQwNmUwMmUwZi5qcGVnkZUCzQJZzQJWwsM></span> <span class=caption>Mr Ibu's wife Stella Maris, claimed that Jazmine is 'a stranger interfering with family matters'</span> <span class=copyright>ece-auto-gen</span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This comes after Stella took to her Instagram page on Sunday, November 12, 2023, alleging that Mr Ibu's adopted daughter was trying to make her an outsider by locking her out of the account. Stella claimed that Jasmine manipulated her into giving up control of the account, however, Daniel stated that she never had control to begin with.</p><p>She cried, “I do not have access to the main Access bank account where people make donations. It is being secretly controlled by Jazmine yet she is cooking up all kinds of lies and propaganda against me to keep absolute control of that account. How she manipulated her way and took control of that account is a story for another day.”</p><p>The renowned actor recently had <a href=# id=8828e3b8-2988-4416-a972-a3a3f86dada4 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>one of his legs amputated</a> in a feat to save his life from an illness he has been battling which <a href=# id=fb7c3e61-ca00-4f79-80f6-6befdc90ceae data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>left him hospitalised</a>. The family sought help from compassionate Nigerians to foot the medical bills, and people have made donations and sent prayers their way since. However, there is some budding family drama regarding donations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGamsV2ZrqW%2FjLCgn51dnsBuus6tZK2dnKG2r7OMrZ%2BeZaSnwrW0jJqZqK2kYrWqv4ybmKejXZawpLvUp6tmpaJitqPB0maqqKZfnIB5ttmsqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
