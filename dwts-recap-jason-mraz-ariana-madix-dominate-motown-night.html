Jason Mraz and Ariana Madix topped the leaderboard, earning the first 9s of the season. At the end of the night, Tyson Beckford and his partner Jenna Johnson were eliminated.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-mraz-ariana-madix-impress-on-dwts-motown-night>Jason Mraz, Ariana Madix Impress on DWTS Motown Night</h2><p>Jason Mraz has proven himself to be a frontrunner in the competition, and this week was no different. He and his partner Daniella Karagach performed a lively Jive to “Do You Love Me” by the Contours. Judge Bruno Tonioli said it was “like watching a scene from a movie.”</p><p>Jason and Daniella Earned a combined score of 34 out of 40, with 9s from Carrie Ann Inaba and guest judge Michael Strahan. That score was matched later in the night, when Ariana Madix and her partner Pasha Pashkov entered the ballroom.</p><p>Ariana and Pasha danced the Quickstep to “You Can’t Hurry Love” by The Supremes, in a performance dedicated to Ariana’s late father. She did so well, Inaba stepped out from behind the judges’ desk and gave Ariana a hug. The routine earned another 34 out of 40.</p><p>This week’s episode also featured an elegant Foxtrot from Charity Lawson and Artem Chigvintsev, which earned them a score of 32 out of 40. At the end of the night, Xochitl Gomez and Val Chmerkovskiy matched that score with a Foxtrot of their own.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JASON MRAZ GETS REAL ABOUT ‘DWTS’: ‘HARDEST THING I’VE EVER DONE’</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>One thing is for sure: we’re jammin’ with <a href=#>@tysoncbeckford</a> & <a href=#>@JennaJohnson</a>! 🕺🏿💃🏻 <a href=#>#DWTS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XLmYECzHUG</a></p>— Dancing with the Stars #DWTS (@officialdwts) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tyson-beckford-jenna-johnson-eliminated>Tyson Beckford, Jenna Johnson Eliminated</h3><p>At the end of the night, one couple had to go home. Voting was open during the show, and it was combined with the judges’ scores to determine who would be eliminated. Last week, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Lynn Spears’ elimination</a> came as a shock, because she wasn’t at the bottom of the leaderboard.</p><p>This week, however, the eliminated couple did have the lowest score of the night. That was Tyson Beckford and Jenna Johnson. They danced the Foxtrot to “Master Blaster (Jammin’)” by Stevie Wonder, earning a score of 20 out of 40 from the judges.</p><p>Meanwhile, last week’s lowest-scoring celebrity, Mauricio Umansky, was safe once again along with his partner Emma Slater. This week, Tonioli said he got “back on track” with his Foxtrot. However, he was still toward the bottom of the leaderboard with 23 out of 40.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s episode?
