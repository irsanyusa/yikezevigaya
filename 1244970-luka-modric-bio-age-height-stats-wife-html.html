The young Luka began to play with his neighbouring kids, especially in the parking lot of the hotel they lived before later joining a football academy where his uncle chipped in the payment. Growing up, he looked up at football legends like Zvonimir Boban and Francesco Totti as for inspiration.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f1a7581f56d6771.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lizzy Musi's biography: age, net worth, boyfriend, racing career</span></p></a><h2>Early career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f3a100be1bd982c2.jpg><p class=align-left>As a 16-year-old teenager, he managed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">secure a position</a> in a local football club named Dinamo Zagreb.
