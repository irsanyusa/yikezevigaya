One such curveball arrived in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult stepdaughter and her children. What began as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;welcome them into their home soon turned into a&nbsp;whirlwind of&nbsp;trouble for one Reddit user. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>, boundaries, and the difficult choices we&nbsp;sometimes must make for our own well-being.</p><p><h2>The woman shared her side of&nbsp;the story.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;married my&nbsp;husband when his daughter, Trudi, was&nbsp;22, she is&nbsp;now 36. He&nbsp;was 47&nbsp;and&nbsp;I was 32. I&nbsp;have two kids, 20&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;now. Both are away at&nbsp;college.</p><p>Trudi never liked&nbsp;me, and that was fine. She has a&nbsp;mother, and she was a&nbsp;full adult living on&nbsp;her own when we&nbsp;met. Her parents had been divorced for six years when&nbsp;I met her father.</p><p>We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;city with lots of&nbsp;tourism, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;easy decision to&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;apartment and do&nbsp;short-term rentals when my&nbsp;kids and&nbsp;I moved in&nbsp;with my&nbsp;husband. We&nbsp;also use it&nbsp;for out-of-town guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe8/373/822736551ca84772ee97e2d2a0.jpg><p>Trudi and her husband ran into some financial problems last year. Trudi and her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> of&nbsp;four moved in&nbsp;with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;agreed that after the holidays, I&nbsp;would stop taking reservations for my&nbsp;apartment, and they could move in&nbsp;there. They would sign a&nbsp;lease, and we&nbsp;would “rent” it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them without collecting rent so&nbsp;they could build up&nbsp;rental history and money.</p><p>Trudi moved in&nbsp;last October. It&nbsp;was hell. She doesn’t help around the house, and neither do&nbsp;her kids. Her husband is&nbsp;working hard to&nbsp;get money together for them, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;comes home exhausted. And he&nbsp;is&nbsp;more help than her or&nbsp;their kids.</p><p>The three of&nbsp;them leave dirty dishes everywhere. Dirty laundry everywhere. The house is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;mess. I&nbsp;have spoken to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them, including my&nbsp;husband, about this. My&nbsp;son-in-law is&nbsp;the only one who makes an&nbsp;effort. Trudi literally said that&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;her father’s house, so&nbsp;I don’t get to&nbsp;tell her what to&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;husband did not back me&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4f/0a8/c4490e5bf6b5bcb7b675f2cf08.jpg><p>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;moved out. My&nbsp;apartment is&nbsp;now empty since the holidays are over. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I didn’t want them treating my&nbsp;property like they were treating my&nbsp;husband’s home.</p><p>They are all mad at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for leaving and changing the plan. She actually threatened to&nbsp;sue me&nbsp;since they have a&nbsp;signed lease. I&nbsp;told her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ahead, since&nbsp;I could prove that&nbsp;I never got the agreed-upon deposit or&nbsp;the first and last month’s rent (which we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;“cover” to&nbsp;help them start over).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f26/cf9/00bf085f84aa897c6adfa1c313.jpg><p>I’ve been here for a&nbsp;week now and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;great. No&nbsp;<a href=# title=noise data-link=tag>noise</a>, no&nbsp;mess, and a&nbsp;much better commute for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;work. My&nbsp;husband has been spending a&nbsp;few nights a&nbsp;week here with&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;wants me&nbsp;to&nbsp;come home and give them the apartment like we&nbsp;agreed. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I would do&nbsp;that if&nbsp;we&nbsp;went back to&nbsp;his house that minute, and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;good shape.</p><p>The narrator’s voiceover goes here, “It&nbsp;was not.” It&nbsp;was disgusting, like it&nbsp;smelled bad. It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;five teenage boys were living there with no&nbsp;supervision.</p><p>She saw me&nbsp;looking around in&nbsp;disgust and said that it&nbsp;wasn’t her fault and that the mess was because they didn’t have their own living space. Yeah, sure. I&nbsp;turned around and went back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6af/dbe/a564fd5785b59436c2cf858dbe.jpg><p>I&nbsp;offered to&nbsp;let my&nbsp;husband move in&nbsp;with me&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted them to&nbsp;have their own space. He&nbsp;won’t because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;retired and likes where he&nbsp;is.</p><p>So&nbsp;like I&nbsp;said, they are all mad at&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;husband, Trudi, and her kids. Trudi’s husband is&nbsp;the only one who understands my&nbsp;position. I&nbsp;will no&nbsp;longer agree to&nbsp;let them in&nbsp;my&nbsp;apartment and&nbsp;I will also only move back once they leave.</p><p><h2>People backed her&nbsp;up.</h2></p><ul><li>“Your husband’s lack of&nbsp;firmness, his failure to&nbsp;back you&nbsp;up, that is&nbsp;what created this mess. He&nbsp;doesn’t get to&nbsp;use your sanctuary to&nbsp;evade that. Stop giving him this getaway. Make him live in&nbsp;the squalor that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;enabling.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notforcommentinohgoo&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;get that divorced or&nbsp;remarried dads often have a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;guilt complex around their kids, especially daughters. But he’s already doing all that he&nbsp;can. You can’t expect to&nbsp;stay with people long-term and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;burden on&nbsp;them with chores and housekeeping. It&nbsp;seems the son-in-law totally understands the situation. I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;your husband can talk to&nbsp;your son-in-law about&nbsp;it.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>monsterseatmonsters&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Your husband is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;given an&nbsp;ultimatum: you or&nbsp;them. And stop letting him sleep over. You are letting him get away from&nbsp;it. Make sure you are not paying any of&nbsp;the bills for your husband’s house, tell him you won’t move back till they have gone, and the whole place has been professionally deep cleaned (he&nbsp;is&nbsp;paying for that)!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Successful_Bath1200&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f2/5ba/d0668559b4a7e50201fc49fa80.jpg><p>We can only change ourselves not others who are already over the age of accountabliity which is in some faiths already at age 8. when you are gone at least your own said property someone else will have to then take on will not be a mess which will take at least a few years clean up to make it liveable at all.</p><ul><li>“You have been supportive and gracious. You have tried to&nbsp;compromise. All of&nbsp;it&nbsp;has been rejected. It’s time to&nbsp;consult an&nbsp;attorney to&nbsp;discuss your options and protect your interests. It’s obvious your husband won’t.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>GTFU-Already&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You aren’t being firm enough in&nbsp;your response, your husband clearly doesn’t understand that he’s allowing not only your home to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disrespected, but he’s allowing YOU to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disrespected. That’s not&nbsp;ok. Why would you want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;that environment at&nbsp;all? I&nbsp;won’t say divorce&nbsp;— but therapy could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good option.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Adorable-Substance21&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You should help family, but they don’t act like they are your family. The opposite, Trudi shows you, that she very much does not plan on&nbsp;seeing you as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the family, so&nbsp;why should you give up&nbsp;your place, an&nbsp;additional income for them to&nbsp;live like that? And by&nbsp;the sound of&nbsp;it, they would trash your place as&nbsp;well. So&nbsp;you would have to&nbsp;pay for renovation after not getting any rent from them.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Trevena_Ice&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>While OP’s decision to&nbsp;step away from her home was undoubtedly one of&nbsp;the hardest decisions she has ever faced, it&nbsp;was also an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;self-preservation, a&nbsp;necessary boundary drawn in&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;her own mental and emotional health. Yet, amidst the pain and uncertainty, there remains a&nbsp;glimmer of&nbsp;hope—a hope that one day, through communication, understanding, and perhaps even reconciliation, her family can find its way back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;harmony and <a href=#>mutual respect</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecCdrKWsXajBprzDmqygoKSav26tzZ1koZ2iYriqsNJmq66qnpqxbrvUq2Shp52aera80qKbnmWUpMSvechmo56epGKur7CMq5yfraOaerW7jKucra2io3q2utOio2asmJrGbq3RnmStoJWnsm6EkHBscmxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
