Citing his connection with Joe Jonas, the Jersey Shore star says Turner is not going to be an option for him romantically.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vinny-guadagnino-says-it-ll-be-messy-to-date-sophie-turner>Vinny Guadagnino Says It’ll Be Messy to Date Sophie Turner</h2><p>Guadagnino do know how to respect the bro code. During his appearance on Page Six’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Virtual Reali-Tea </a>podcast, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> alum weighed in on the possibility of him hitting on Turner.</p><p>“I actually was friends with Joe at a certain point, so that might get a little messy,” he said. “I hung out with him in Vegas for one weekend and I think this was, like, in more of the off years with the Jonas Brothers.”</p><p>According to Guadagnino, he and Jonas have mutual friends, giving them the chance to hang out before. Referencing their casual bonding, the television personality claimed that Jonas is a “good guy.”</p><p>For that solid reason, Guadagnino can’t see himself dating Turner anytime soon. Nonetheless, he is appreciative of the actress who allegedly is a fan of Jersey Shore.</p><p>“[The Jersey Shore cast has] heard that a lot over the years and that means a lot,” Guadagnino said. “I’m a huge Game of Thrones fan.”</p><p>After four years of marriage, Jonas and Turner have decided to call it quits. In early September, Jonas filed for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce</a> from the Game of Thrones alum. As per the document, the musician claimed that “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-reacts-to-gabby-windey-s-new-relationship>He Reacts to Gabby Windey’s New Relationship</h2><p>At present, Guadagnino is single and ready to mingle while gearing up for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Star Shore season two</a>. His most recent speculated partner was fellow DWTS alum Gabby Windey, who recently came out as queer, revealing that she’s now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dating comedian Robby Hoffman</a>.</p><p>Guadagnino and the former Bachelorette star have exchanged flirty banters on social media during their time on DWTS. Upon knowing Windey’s announcement, the Jersey Shore alum said that he’s happy to know that she’s now setting herself free.</p><p>“I did the [Dancing With the Stars] tour with [Windey] a few months ago and it was funny because she was so stressed out on that tour because she did every single date,” he said. “But after seeing this today, I’m so happy to see her be happy and live her truth and to see her face again.”</p><p>When asked is he would go out with Windey and Hoffman, Guadagnino answered, “Of course, yeah. Gabby’s a good friend of mine, for sure.”</p><p>Back in DWTS season 31, Guadagnino and Windey confused fans if there’s a brewing romance between them amid their coy exchanges on Instagram. The Bachelorette alum later addressed their hilarious online flirtation, claiming that they were nothing but friends.</p><p>“Apparently both of us just like to kind of stir the post. Which is, like, funny. But [the buzz] did happen out of nowhere,” she said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_OliviaRodrigo_Theo-WargoGetty-Images-for-MTV-220x147.jpeg alt="Ticketmaster Sets New Rule, Fans Will Receive Olivia Rodrigo Tour Tickets 72 Hours Before The Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aKlp7FdnMKisMCgpaKmn2KworrNqKtmnJGpsm6%2Fzqmfop1dqcKzusSrZKGdoprAbsPHsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
