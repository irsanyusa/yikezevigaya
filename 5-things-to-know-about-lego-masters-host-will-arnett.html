Here are five things you might not have known about Arnett.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-he-has-won-13-awards-for-acting>1. He Has Won 13 Awards For Acting</h2><p>I promise he has been in way more than you think. He’s been in many shows and has won 13 awards with <a href=#>27 nominations</a> in total. He is the perfect person to host Lego Masters because he’s a pretty big name in the Lego universe. Arnett is the voice of Batman in both the <a href=#>Lego Batman</a> and Lego movies.</p><p>On top of his Batman career, he also is Gob Bluth in <a href=#>Arrested Development</a>, the voice of <a href=#>Bojack Horseman</a>, Jeff in <a href=#>Riviera</a>, and <a href=#>more</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-his-podcast-was-nominated-for-an-iheartradio-award>2. His Podcast Was Nominated For an iHeartRadio Award</h2><p>Arnett is a part of the podcast <a href=#>SmartLess </a>with Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes. The trio is known for their conversations, guests, and hilarious jokes. Each week, one member brings a guest that the other two don’t know about. Since the two people can’t prepare for the guest, it creates a very authentic conversation.</p><p>Some of SmartLess‘s recent guests have been <a href=# class=broken_link>Joy Reid</a>, Ryan Reynolds, Lebron James, Elizabeth Banks, along with <a href=# class=broken_link>others</a>. In 2021, SmartLess was <a href=#>nominated for iHeartradio</a>‘s best comedy podcast award, but lost to <a href=#>The Read (Loud Speakers Network)</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-he-s-been-married-twice-and-has-three-kids>3. He’s Been Married Twice and Has Three Kids</h2><p>In 1994, he married Penelope Ann Miller, and the two split in 1995. He then married Amy Poehler in 2003 and had two kids with her. They worked together in Arrested Development, <a href=#>Blades of Glory</a>, and <a href=#>Horton Hears a Who</a>! They had two kids together, Archie and Abel. Their kids are now 12 and 10 years old respectively.</p><p>In 2012, Arnett and Poehler announced their separation, but their divorce was not finalized until 2016. During quarantine last year, Poehler and Arnett were <a href=#>quarantining/co-parenting together</a>. Even though the ex-couple quarantined together, he is not out of the dating scene. He has been dating Alessandra Brawn since 2019. The two welcomed their first child on June 12, 2020.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-he-went-to-multiple-high-schools-and-dropped-out-of-college>4. He Went To Multiple High Schools and Dropped Out Of College</h2><p>The canadian actor explains that he likes variety, which is why he went to multiple high schools in Toronto. His response in this <a href=#>2018 interview</a> was very <a href=#>BoJack Horseman-like</a>. He specifically mentioned that one high school said he’s an acquired taste, he then had to move onto the next one. Arnett then went to Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ontario, but was asked not to return because he was a troublemaker. From there he went to Leaside High School where he graduated.</p><p>“I dropped out of college but I don’t want to do an endorsement for a place that I dropped out of,” said Arnett in an <a href=#>interview</a>. “In Montreal, a school that’ll remain… Concordia.” He attended Concordia University for one semester before he dropped out to pursue acting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-he-uses-his-batman-voice-when-his-kids-misbehave>5. He Uses His Batman Voice When His Kids Misbehave</h2><p>Arnett’s kids don’t need to wonder what it would be like to have a super hero as a father. In 2019, Arnett sat down with <a href=#>ET Canada</a> and talked about how he shifts into Lego Batman when his kids are arguing.</p><p>“Actually to be honest, what I usually do, of course they’re 8 and 10, two boys so they all disagree over things or fight over the same toys or whatever it is and I always just slide into not necessarily, I don’t think of it as Batman but I just think I never yell or raise my voice I just go down to here,” Arnett said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/RmRayuAgR54</p></figure><p>Catch Arnett on Lego Masters on Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thumbnail_photoByLeonBennett_GettyImages.jpg alt="Jordin Sparks Calls Jennifer Hudson “Stunning” as Aretha Franklin in “Respect”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Lego Masters</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>will arnett</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGaroaGenMBuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWSlnZekeq6t0q2cq6tdnby0wIywoKWkXZa%2Fr7HTrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
