At&nbsp;85&nbsp;years of&nbsp;age, he&nbsp;holds the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Guinness</a> World Record for being the actor who had won an&nbsp;Oscar at&nbsp;the oldest age, when at&nbsp;83, he&nbsp;received the award for his performance in&nbsp;the film <i>The Father</i>. But that’s not the only thing Hopkins found at&nbsp;a&nbsp;mature age. His Colombian wife, Stella Arroyave, and he&nbsp;met when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his sixties. She brought a&nbsp;new energy that keeps him active and very happy.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> looked into their story and wants to&nbsp;share with you how his wife has <a href=# title=motivated data-link=tag>motivated</a> him to&nbsp;continue acting. Their relationship shows&nbsp;us that the last love is&nbsp;always the most important thing in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>Two failed marriages</h2></p><p>Anthony Hopkins’ first marriage was celebrated in&nbsp;1966. He&nbsp;married English actress Petronella Barker. Although it&nbsp;lasted only 7&nbsp;years, they had a&nbsp;daughter in&nbsp;1969, singer and songwriter Abigail Hopkins.</p><p>His second marriage was to&nbsp;Jennifer Lynton, a&nbsp;production assistant. They were together for 29&nbsp;years, until 2002, but the relationship faded over time. In&nbsp;the last years, the couple lived apart. Around that time, Hopkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;live a&nbsp;separate life and am&nbsp;not very good with any relationships&nbsp;— with anyone. I&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;locked up&nbsp;with anyone for too long.”</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new hope at&nbsp;64</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7dd/636/bcbae454fba3fe1ab97e8d504f.jpg><p>But everything changed when he&nbsp;met Stella Arroyave in&nbsp;2001. A&nbsp;year had passed since his second divorce, and at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;64, the actor was going through a&nbsp;difficult time.</p><p>One day he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;antique store in&nbsp;Los Angeles, where Arroyave worked, and they fell for each other from the minute they met. Hopkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> that she didn’t walk up&nbsp;to&nbsp;greet him but looked like she was dancing.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Arroyave</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and producer born in&nbsp;Popayán, a&nbsp;small Colombian town. She left her country to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;the United States with the dream of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;actress. She started in&nbsp;New York, then moved to&nbsp;Los Angeles, where she opened an&nbsp;antique business and an&nbsp;art gallery in&nbsp;Malibu.</p><p>A&nbsp;relationship with Stella, 18&nbsp;years his junior, changed his life. Anthony <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>, “She met me&nbsp;ten years ago when&nbsp;I was shut down. I&nbsp;didn’t feel shut down at&nbsp;that time. Not trusting anyone. Certainly not trusting women.”</p><p>In&nbsp;2003 they were married at&nbsp;the actor’s Malibu mansion in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intimate</a> wedding attended by&nbsp;25&nbsp;people, including <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg" data-link=tag>Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href=# title="Winona Ryder" data-link=tag>Winona Ryder</a>, <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a>, <a href=# title="Catherine Zeta-Jones" data-link=tag>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, and Mickey Rooney. As&nbsp;Anthony was awarded the title of&nbsp;Sir by&nbsp;British royalty in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1993</a>, his wife became Lady Stella Hopkins.</p><p><h2>Love saved his life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/810/8ce/43fd9b50d493fde2d4f1cff394.jpg><p>The actor has pointed out that it&nbsp;was thanks to&nbsp;Stella that he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;the pit. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;am married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who has an&nbsp;optimism that is&nbsp;foolproof. From the moment she opens her eyes, she is&nbsp;happy. She tells me&nbsp;all the time to&nbsp;stop worrying and live in&nbsp;the moment. She taught me&nbsp;to&nbsp;enjoy life. I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the precipice, but&nbsp;I took a&nbsp;step back and now&nbsp;I know that every day&nbsp;I live is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift.”</p><p>Anthony credits Stella’s quiet nature for helping him deal with the difficulties of&nbsp;fame and now doesn’t care what people think of&nbsp;him. Hopkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notes</a>, “My&nbsp;philosophy&nbsp;is: it’s none of&nbsp;my&nbsp;business what people say and think about&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;am what I&nbsp;am, and I&nbsp;do what I&nbsp;do. I&nbsp;don’t expect anything, and&nbsp;I accept everything. And it&nbsp;makes life so&nbsp;much easier.”</p><p><h2>Fell in&nbsp;love with Colombia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea4/760/1444435b178f19b033accb3f8e.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>But those have not been the only changes Stella has made in&nbsp;the actor’s life, since thanks to&nbsp;her Colombian roots, she has made him a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;Colombian flavors, colors, and rhythms, as&nbsp;she mentioned in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p>“Tony (Anthony) loves arepas. He&nbsp;eats one for breakfast almost every day, and we&nbsp;also listen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;Colombian music together. Because of&nbsp;my&nbsp;Latin nature, I&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;every day smiling and wanting to&nbsp;dance, a&nbsp;far cry from the Welsh temperament, which is&nbsp;much more subdued. Together we&nbsp;have found a&nbsp;good balance.”</p><p>Hopkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describes</a> Stella as: “A&nbsp;wonderful woman who likes to&nbsp;spend money”. But this is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;flaw, on&nbsp;the contrary, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the qualities that made the actor fall in&nbsp;love with her, the way she enjoys life but at&nbsp;the same time takes care of&nbsp;it.</p><p>“’She’s very good for&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;wife, because she slows me&nbsp;down. This morning&nbsp;I was sitting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant and&nbsp;I was leaning back in&nbsp;my&nbsp;chair jiggling away and she said, ’Don’t do&nbsp;that.’ I&nbsp;said, ’Why?’ She said, ’Cause you could collapse!’ She looks after me&nbsp;that way and she needs&nbsp;to, because my&nbsp;nature is&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things very fast because&nbsp;I have convinced myself that I&nbsp;am still 45&nbsp;years old. I&nbsp;walk far too fast and I’m always falling over and she reminds me&nbsp;not&nbsp;to.”</p><p><h2>Now he&nbsp;dances life away.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/478/034/61277e5f73993ec32b2633d3e4.jpg><p>At&nbsp;84&nbsp;years old, the energy and <a href=# title=joy data-link=tag>joy</a> that actor Anthony Hopkins acquired overflows the screen and is&nbsp;contagious. He&nbsp;has posted several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>videos</a> in&nbsp;which you can see him wearing summer clothes, a&nbsp;Panamá hat, and dancing cumbia or&nbsp;merengue. He&nbsp;sometimes even says, “I&nbsp;am Colombian.”</p><p>Undoubtedly, all this energy and joy comes from the love in&nbsp;his life and shows&nbsp;us that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;never too late to&nbsp;find true love.</p><p>What or&nbsp;who brings happiness into your life?
