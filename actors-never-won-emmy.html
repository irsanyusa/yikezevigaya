Long considered television’s biggest night, Emmy competition has become increasingly stiff as high-quality shows <a href=#>have proliferated</a>, thanks in part to the continued expansion of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. For many actors, 2019 marks a final chance to take home a prize after years of playing a beloved character: shows including <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> and<a href=#> Veep</a> recently ended their blockbuster runs. That means that stars like <a href=#>Kit Harington</a>, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, <a href=#>Sophie Turner</a>, Maisie Williams, Alfie Allen and <a href=#>Gwendoline Christie</a> are all looking to snag that elusive Emmy for their roles on the HBO behemoth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Similarly, Veep‘s Anna Chlumsky is up for an award after five years with no luck; over at ABC’s Black-ish, Anthony Anderson has come up empty-handed for eight years, while <a href=#>Sandra Oh</a>, nominated this year for Killing Eve, received many nominations but no prizes throughout her many years on Grey’s Anatomy. Some of this may change Sunday night, but even if it doesn’t, these famous actors are in good company, with plenty of other successful stars — like Steve Carrell, David Duchovny and Mindy Kaling — whose lauded small-screen performances failed to yield Emmys hardware.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read on to see the famous actors who still have yet to win an Emmy Award.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Kit Harington</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kit-harington.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After starring as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones — which just completed its final season — Harington is up for an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Actor this year. He was nominated in 2016 as a supporting actor on the show but has never won. Thrones was Harington’s breakout TV role, and the project to which he’s devoted most of his acting career so far.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Jason Bateman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jason-bateman.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year marks <a href=#>Bateman</a>‘s first Emmy nomination, for Outstanding Drama Actor in Netflix’s Ozark. He’s also nominated this year for directing in a drama series, for the Ozark episode “Reparations.” But he’s probably best known — on TV, anyway — for playing the beloved character Michael Bluth on Arrested Development over the course of five seasons (none of which panned out with an Emmy for Bateman).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Milo Ventimiglia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/milo-ventimiglia.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=#>This Is Us star</a> was also nominated in 2017 and 2018, in addition to this year, for Outstanding Drama Actor in the popular series. Ventimiglia has been gracing TV screens for awhile, growing up as a heartthrob on shows like Gilmore Girls and Heroes, but it’s only recently that the TV Academy has recognized his work.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Billy Porter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/billy-porter.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While <a href=#>Porter</a> has received a Tony for his work on Broadway, 2019 marks the Pose star and Broadway veteran’s first Emmy nomination.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Emilia Clarke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emilia-clarke.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before Game of Thrones, <a href=#>Clarke</a> had few notable acting credits to her name; the character of Daenerys Targaryen launched her to fame. She was nominated in 2013, 2015 and 2016 for her supporting role on Thrones, and this year she’s up for Outstanding Drama Actress for her work on the show’s final season.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Robin Wright</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robin-wright.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wright received her sixth Emmy nomination this year for her role as <a href=#>Claire Underwood</a> on Netflix’s long-running House of Cards, where she led the series’ sixth season after Kevin Spacey was <a href=#>removed from the show</a>. Wright is a household name, but before she became an Underwood was better known for her film roles, including in the classic Princess Bride. Still, Wright is not a TV newbie; she was on the 1980s series Santa Barbara.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sandra Oh</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sandra-oh.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is <a href=#>not Oh’s first</a> Emmy rodeo: thanks to Grey’s Anatomy, she was a nominee as Outstanding Drama Actress every year from 2005 through 2009. Killing Eve gave her another shot in 2018, with no luck. This year she’s up again for the same role, as well as for an SNL guest spot.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Mandy Moore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mandy-moore.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>This Is Us </i>has brought <a href=#>Moore</a> her most successful TV role, and it earned her an Emmy nomination this year, for Outstanding Drama Actress.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Giancarlo Esposito</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/giancarlo-esposito.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The longtime <a href=#>TV and film actor</a> was nominated in 2012 for his work on Breaking Bad. Now he’s up for a prize for his work on the prequel to that show, Better Call Saul. His TV background has been extensive, with stints on shows like Homicide, Law & Order, Revolution, Netflix’s The Get Down and Once Upon a Time.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Alfie Allen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/alfie-allen.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Game of Thrones actor received his first Emmy nod this year for his work as an emotional <a href=#>Theon Greyjoy</a> in the show’s final season. Prior to Thrones, he had appeared in movies like 2007’s Atonement and had small roles on some TV series, but Theon was Allen’s big breakout.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nikolaj-coster-waldau.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fellow Game of Thrones actor <a href=#>Coster-Waldau</a> is up for a second time for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of conflicted knight Jaime Lannister. Coster-Waldau has been acting for awhile, although most of his pre-Thrones credits were in the movie world, not TV.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Lena Headey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lena-headey.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After five nominations for her work as Cersei Lannister on Game of Thrones, this is <a href=#>Headey</a>‘s last chance with that show to nab the elusive prize for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Before playing Cersei, Headey was a working actor for nearly two decades, with roles in an eclectic mix of shows and movies from a Merlin show to the action film 300.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Gwendoline Christie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gwendoline-christie.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Christie</a>, who joined Thrones in its second season, finally got some recognition from the Emmys this year, with her first nomination for her role as Brienne of Tarth. Christie has only a few credits before Thrones, but since then has nabbed roles in the Star Wars movies and the TV series Top of the Lake.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sophie-turner.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is <a href=#>Turner</a>‘s first year with Emmy attention as well, after finishing her turn as Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones.
