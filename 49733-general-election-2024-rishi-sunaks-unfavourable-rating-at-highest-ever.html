This gives a net approval figure of -51, the joint lowest Sunak has experienced to date (having previously scored this poorly in mid-May and also mid-January).</p><p data-block-key=8r58h>Attitudes towards the Conservative party are just as bad – 70% have a negative view of the Tories in general compared to only 21% with a positive view.</p><p data-block-key=b9900>Meanwhile, the number of Britons with a positive view of Keir Starmer is the highest it has been since late 2022, with 39% of the public feeling favourably towards the Labour leader. Nevertheless, 51% still have an unfavourable view, giving an overall net score of -12.</p><p data-block-key=dp3hd>Attitudes towards the Labour party are more closely divided, with 44% having a positive view of Britain’s main left wing party while 47% have a negative view.</p><p data-block-key=ee6on>Elsewhere, the Liberal Democrats are marginally more popular than they were before the election was called, with 37% having a positive view compared to 33% in mid-May; on both occasions 47% had a negative view of the party. Nevertheless, this is the best score for the Liberal Democrats this parliament (although we should note that we have only tracked the party’s popularity on a few occasions)</p><p data-block-key=ca94v>The Greens perform slightly better, with 41% having a favourable opinion towards them and 40% an unfavourable one – this is generally consistent with the party’s performance historically.</p><p data-block-key=c4rn9>Reform UK have also become seen the number of people with a positive opinion of them increase since the election was called, albeit from a low base. In mid-May 20% of Britons said they had a favourable view of the party; that figure is now 27%. Most people (56%) have a negative view of Reform UK, however – a figure that has also increased since before the election (from 48%).</p><h3 id=how-popular-are-other-politicians data-block-key=t16am>How popular are other politicians?</h3><p data-block-key=d8964>From our disparate selection of other politicians, deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner proves to come second in terms of popularity (30%), followed by Nigel Farage (29%).</p><p data-block-key=dmfu2>Other Labour politicians prove to be largely unknown to the public, with 51% of Britons answering “don’t know” when asked what they think of shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, rising to 64% for shadow health secretary Wes Streeting.</p><p data-block-key=8jmj1>Potential Tory leadership successor Penny Mordaunt has the highest favourable figure on the list of Conservative politicians, at 23% – within the margin of error of Rishi Sunak’s own score, although far fewer people have a negative view of Mordaunt (42%). Another potential contender, Suella Braverman, is much less popular (16% have a positive view and 58% a negative view), while Kemi Badenoch is largely unfamiliar to the public (56% don’t know what they think about her).</p><p data-block-key=247j8><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=f43h0>What do you think about Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer, the election campaign, and everything else?
