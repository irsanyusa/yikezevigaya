Tonioli was emotional as he shared how he saw himself in the young dancers.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bruno-tonioli-breaks-bgt-golden-buzzer-for-dance-group>Bruno Tonioli Breaks BGT Golden Buzzer for Dance Group</h2><p>Phoenix Boys is a group of young male dancers from around the UK. Because they all live in different places, the group was only able to rehearse three times before their audition for BGT. You’d never know they had such little time to practice, because they delivered an incredible performance.</p><p>Their routine included acrobatic flips and leaps through the air. The crowd cheered as they performed, and the judges looked amazed by the audition. Bruno Tonioli was especially impressed, as he wasted no time hitting the Golden Buzzer.</p><p>He was so enthusiastic that the buzzer actually cracked when he hit it. Fellow judge Alesha Dixon had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted about the wild moment</a> on Instagram when the show was filming auditions earlier this year. Now we know the context.</p><p>This is Tonioli’s second Golden Buzzer of the season. He previously hit it for singer Taryn Charles. The show has thrown out the rulebook this season, as Amanda Holden also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hit a second Golden Buzzer</a> during last week’s show.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OPERA SINGER COVERS ‘BGT’ JUDGES IN SPAGHETTI IN EARLY RELEASE CLIP</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tonioli-shared-his-thoughts-on-the-audition>Tonioli Shared His Thoughts on the Audition</h2><p>Tonioli’s fellow judges were shocked that he hit the Golden Buzzer so suddenly, and that he managed to break it. As Phoenix Boys celebrated on stage, Holden asked Tonioli, “Did they remind you of you?” He responded, “Yes.”</p><p>“I know how hard it is, what you do,” Tonioli told the group members. “People don’t really understand how hard it is to succeed as a dancer. The work that goes into it, and the passion. And literally, you do it for nothing. You do it for love. And I felt that.”</p><p>Dixon said she saw “the emotional connection that Bruno felt,” adding, “I knew that he could see himself in you.” Simon Cowell predicted that their next performance will be “even better than what we saw today.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Original_AsherHaVon_Tyler-Golden_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Asher HaVon Named ‘The Voice’ Season 25 Winner on Team Reba McEntire" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bruno tonioli</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wausp6ddqbyvtc6loGaaopqurL%2BMrZ%2BeZZKcwW6zzqWbnqZdl8K7xsSrZJ%2BnomK0s7vUqWSonl2uvLa6xmabmqaTmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
