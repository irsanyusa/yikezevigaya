To&nbsp;make sure he’s capable of&nbsp;emotional intimacy, women often want to&nbsp;examine their man’s behavior toward his mother. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt that a&nbsp;boy who nurtures a&nbsp;close bond with his mother grows up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;stable and confident man.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;relationship with their mother determines attachment style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/268/919/ddbc21589280394e98aafb519f.jpg><p>One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> shows a&nbsp;connection between mother and child behaviors. Children who experienced a&nbsp;positive response from their mother during distress were less likely to&nbsp;develop an&nbsp;unhealthy attachment style later in&nbsp;life. On&nbsp;the other side, if&nbsp;the mother’s behavior is&nbsp;unpredictable or&nbsp;harsh, that will have a&nbsp;negative impact on&nbsp;the child’s future <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a>. Therefore, men capable of&nbsp;healthy attachment owe it&nbsp;largely to&nbsp;their moms.</p><p><h2>They have good social skills.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ab/988/fa78dc55ff9375825575596601.jpg><p>Many <a href=# title=psychologists data-link=tag>psychologists</a> say that sons who regularly experience conflict with their mothers are more likely to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;anti-social behavior. Having an&nbsp;open and caring conversation with a&nbsp;kid instead of&nbsp;fighting will set a&nbsp;base for developing useful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>social skills</a> and stable friendships. Following that, boys who have good communication with their mothers are less likely to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;physical fights and make problems in&nbsp;school.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;close relationship with their mother boosts their confidence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a6/62d/54e6765b459a3b4a48478eb92b.jpg><p>Maternal warmth in&nbsp;infancy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;foundation for a&nbsp;child’s eventual self-esteem. This dependency on&nbsp;the parent-child relationship decreases in&nbsp;adolescence as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child seeks to&nbsp;form new relationships with peers. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shown</a> that adolescents still need a&nbsp;strong and secure bond with a&nbsp;parent to&nbsp;feel safe and confident. A&nbsp;boy who feels his mother’s support won’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;explore the outside world.</p><p><h2>They are at&nbsp;lower risk of&nbsp;mental health problems.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d7/0be/48b75e5ad2a058947d2d333913.jpg><p>Another study <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggests</a> that overall, a&nbsp;good relationship with parents, especially a&nbsp;mother, lowers the risk of&nbsp;developing mental disorders later in&nbsp;life. Researchers indicate that boys who did not receive proper care from their mothers fail to&nbsp;develop emotion regulation strategies and, therefore, are more vulnerable to&nbsp;emotional distress in&nbsp;adulthood.</p><p><h2>They aren’t prone to&nbsp;toxic behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89c/6f7/c921e75e388e91d3f3b3fbe433.jpg><p>Raising boys to&nbsp;be&nbsp;harsh and fearless can do&nbsp;more harm than good to&nbsp;their <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a>. By&nbsp;neglecting boys’ feelings and teaching them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>real men</a>,” parents are ignoring their sons’ emotional needs. This leads boys to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;development of&nbsp;unhealthy and toxic coping mechanisms. A&nbsp;mother who teaches her son to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vulnerable</a> sometimes will surely raise a&nbsp;confident and stable man.</p><p><h2>They are better romantic partners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/412/463/a83f6a59d498cc89004d734a3a.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;widely known that parents are role models to&nbsp;their children and can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>affect</a> their offsprings’ romantic relationships. Studies indicate that a&nbsp;boy who shares a&nbsp;healthy relationship with his mother will grow into a&nbsp;caring and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>respectful</a> spouse. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;close to&nbsp;his mother, you can be&nbsp;sure that he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;an&nbsp;emotionally aware and open partner.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;close mother-son bond increases emotional intelligence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d8c/219/3487e25e4ab717c145616e3de3.jpeg><p>Research shows that boys who know their feelings are validated tend to&nbsp;have higher <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emotional intelligence</a>. A&nbsp;man who is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;his feelings and secure about them has more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;likelihood to&nbsp;form strong relationships later in&nbsp;life. A&nbsp;close relationship with his mother encourages a&nbsp;son’s emotional expression, which increases his empathy and deepens his relationships and communication with other people.</p><p><h2>They are overall happier.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de2/c09/319ac75e7b9d6f4d0709d8185f.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>It’s not a&nbsp;novelty that children who grow up&nbsp;in&nbsp;supportive families grow to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happier and more successful, both in&nbsp;private and professional life. Psychologists suggest that boys who grew up&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;love showed better performance in&nbsp;school and were less susceptible to&nbsp;peer pressure. Confidence that a&nbsp;mother’s love builds leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man’s higher <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>overall happiness</a> and satisfaction with life.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mother-son relationship from your surroundings?
