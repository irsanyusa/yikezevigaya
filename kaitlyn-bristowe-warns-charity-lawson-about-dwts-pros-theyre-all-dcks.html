The season 29 winner has recently warned fellow Bachelorette alum about the show’s pros, especially Alan Bersten.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kaitlyn-bristowe-says-alan-bersten-all-dwts-pros-are-d-cks>Kaitlyn Bristowe Says Alan Bersten, All DWTS Pros are “D*cks”</h2><p>During the September 7 episode of Off The Vine podcast, Bristowe generously shared some useful advice for Lawson before her upcoming debut on DWTS season 32. For those who may not know, Bristowe won season 29 of the competition in 2020 with partner Artem Chigvintsev.</p><p>“You always got to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” she said. “You’re doing something really fun, and don’t forget that because people getting really caught up in the — I did — I got really caught up in the competition of it and making it further.”</p><p>According to the season 29 winner, joining the series is “harder than anybody thinks,” but is also about making other people happy at home. Bristowe also speculated which of the show’s dancing pros could become Lawson’s match.</p><p>“I think possibly Artem because [of] the height. I think possibly Alan [Bersten] because I could see them putting you with him, only because he’s one of the more well-loved, I feel like, out of a lot of them. And I feel like I could see you and your fun personality with him,” she said.</p><p>Bristowe then noted that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bersten</a> can be “crazy in the ballroom.” She continued, warning that Bersten and other DWTS could be quite competitive during the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“He’s kind of a d*ck, but I can see it. Well, they’re all d*cks. They’re all d*cks, I’m telling you. Buckle up,” she said.</p><p>Unfortunately, the We’re Alive: Goldrush actress didn’t elaborate much on the revelation. Lawson has perhaps taken notes, but is nonetheless hopeful that season3 2 will be an enjoyable experience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-reveals-her-dream-pick-for-the-bachelorette-star>She Reveals Her Dream Pick for the Bachelorette Star</h2><p>Despite Bristowe’s apparent vendetta against some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pros, she still has good words to say about the others. In the podcast, she revealed that her dream pick as Lawson’s partner would be Brandon Armstrong.</p><p>“Brandon is so fun. He’s probably the nicest and he’s just so goofy and sweet and means well and so fun,” she gushed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the podcast, Bristowe shared how Chigvintsev was as a dancing partner and choreographer. &nbsp;</p><p>“Artem is so hardcore,” she said. “He’s Russian and that’s how he was trained growing up. He’ll believe in you, and he’ll push you to your limits, which we love. And then Alan would be an absolute nightmare, but it would be really, like, he would take you far.”</p><p>Amid Bristowe’s bold warnings, the former DWTS champion also shared light advice for Lawson. For an unwrinkled and suave season 32 journey, she reminded the fellow Bachelorette alum of ice baths.</p><p>“Get yourself an ice footbath,” Bristowe advised. “You just gotta ice your feet, battle through the pain, smile, enjoy, and always come back to the two of you [Lawson and her fiancé Dotun Olubeko] at the end of the day. Because it’s going to go by so fast.”</p><p>Lawson was announced as one of the celebrities joining the season 32 last month during the The Bachelorette season 20 After the Final Rose episode. Meanwhile, the full cast will be revealed next week.</p><p>Dancing With The Stars is rumored to return to television on September 26, Tuesday, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_Grimes_ElonMusk_Taylor-HillGetty-Images.jpg alt="Elon Musk, Grimes Revealed to Have a Third Child Together" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqgraSpo3qjvsisq6ivlWLEor7NrGScoJGntrXFjKWYsKufo3qirs6uq2acp6nAbrzRqKpmrJiaxrOxjJqjpWWUmLi0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
