Her life traces back to Buenos-Aires, the capital of Argentina, where she was born on June 16th, 1997. Camila Morrone age is 21 years old, which is impressive, considering how much she has done for her career.</p><p class=align-left>At the start of her career, Camila used to grace the covers and pages of various magazines. She had an experience with the IMG agency, where she made her first steps as a model. The rising star even appeared in the ads for such famous brands as Sports Illustrated, Urban Outfitters and Victoria Secret's Pink. She graced the Turkish cover of Vogue magazine, which is the most desired appearance for any professional model.

Her most famous movie so far was the action drama "Death Wish," where she portrayed the role of Jordan Kersey. In this dramatic movie, she had a chance to play alongside the legendary Bruce Willis. Some of the other productions she appeared in were "Never Goin' Back," "Mickey and the Bear," and "Bukowski."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/1dfa67dd5cb6a5dc.jpeg><p class=align-left>Camila resides in Los Angeles, where she spends most of her free time preparing for her upcoming auditions. She also enjoys hiking and says that this is a very L.A. sort of hobby. After hiking, she rewards herself with the sandwich, pizza or pasta instead of the usual vegetables or salad. She enjoys learning how to cook. Occasionally, she flies out to New York to meet movie directors and read the scripts.</p><p class=align-left>The actress prefers natural and pure beauty to something crazy and out of place. She always uses essential face care components before sleep. However, she says that it is not always possible to be consistent with beauty routines and advises people not to focus on it overly. When she goes travelling, she usually puts some Neosporin in her nose to avoid getting sick, and it is beneficial for her. In general, she enjoys travelling and does not go to the same places twice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/dbf21c8696317498.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting facts about Phyllis Smith, "The Office" star</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The star says</a> that even though she has a massive fanbase on Instagram, she occasionally takes breaks from it for the sake of her mental health.

Later, Camila's parents split up, and Lucila eventually started a relationship with the famous Hollywood actor Al Pacino.</p><p class=align-left>Camila Morrone is not the only child in her family: she also has a younger brother, whose name is Sky. So far, he stays out of the spotlight, unlike his sister and parents.</p><h3>Camila Morrone and Leonardo DiCaprio: what is happening between them?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/efee6746b31506c3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Strong rumours are going on about Camila Morrone dating the big name Hollywood actor, the charming Leonardo DiCaprio. The two reportedly met through Camila's stepfather Al Pacino, who is Leo's close friend. There is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a lot of proof</a> that these two are in a romantic relationship because they were noticed interacting affectionately with each other a lot of times throughout the last year. There are a lot of photos and videos where the lovebirds are holding hands and gazing at each other lovingly. However, even though it has come to the public eye that they are together, Leonardo and Camila are trying their best to remain private and not to flaunt their relationship too much.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/fba52f9ce99ca1bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Valeria Lukyanova?

For starters, DiCaprio has had a lot of girlfriends over the years, and most of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his relationships</a> were short-lived. Another reason for collective disbelief was the significant age difference between the two: Leonardo is 44, while Camila is 21. Despite everything, the couple seems to be still together, and the fans are eagerly waiting for the updates on their relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, DiCaprio and Morrone are spotted shopping and hanging out together. On New Year's Day, they went to Thailand on a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romantic trip</a>, and they were also spotted at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Coachella festival</a>. Except that, they attended the 60th <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday celebration</a> of Ellen DeGeneres and hung together with Tobey Maguire once - and the list of their everyday adventures goes on and on.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f135b3f391d55f5c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Brandi Glanville?
