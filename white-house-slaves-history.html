And, while recent attention has largely focused on the executive mansion’s construction, the overview highlights another facet of that past: seven U.S. presidents owned slaves during their time in office there.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Tyler, Polk, and Taylor all owned slaves while living in the White House.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In fact, slaves were lodged at the White House far past its construction. Jefferson was the first to bring his slaves — a dozen of his household servants from Monticello — to 1600 Pennsylvania. After Jefferson, Madison brought slaves from his Virginia estate. The earliest known account of slavery in the White House, Paul Jennings’ <a href=# rel=noopener>A Colored Man’s Reminisces of James Madison</a>, comes from that period. In it, Jennings recounts being moved to Washington, D.C.:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28.5><p>When Mr. Madison was chosen President, we came on and moved into the White House; the east room was not finished, and Pennsylvania Avenue was not paved, but was always in an awful condition from either mud or dust. The city was a dreary place.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following the building’s <a href=#>destruction</a> during the War of 1812, slave labor was also used to rebuild the mansion between 1814 and 1818. (Nor was the White House the only D.C. landmark built by slaves: in 2012, the U.S. Capitol Building <a href=# rel=noopener>unveiled a plaque commemorating</a> the pivotal role of slave labor in its construction.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In addition to the seven presidents who owned slaves during their terms, four presidents had slaves at other points in their lives: Van Buren, Harrison, Andrew Johnson and Grant. And George Washington owned between 250 and 300 slaves during his presidency, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies</a>, though he left office before completion of the White House.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Zachary Taylor’s presidency ended with his death in 1850, freed African Americans in D.C. outnumbered those enslaved by <a href=# rel=noopener>almost two to one</a>, according to Census Records. That same year, Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, which was meant to end the slave trade in new states.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it would take another 12 years before slavery was abolished in D.C. on April 16, 1862, with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Emancipation Act</a>, which freed about 3,000 enslaved African Americans. Nine months later, Lincoln signed the more widely recognized Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For decades after the end of the Civil War, African Americans held an annual <a href=# rel=noopener>Emancipation Day</a> parade in D.C. to demand the full rights of citizenship. A century later, in 2004, <a href=# rel=noopener>D.C. made Emancipation Day a legal holiday</a>, to “symbolize for Americans the triumph of the human spirit over the cruelty of slavery.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGJtgHeEjrCfoqyVYrWwwdKeZKykkauytHnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
