Her audience embraces people of&nbsp;absolutely different ages, and representatives of&nbsp;older generations seem to&nbsp;adore her, too. Taylor keeps breaking records, becoming the Person of&nbsp;the Year by&nbsp;the version of&nbsp;Time. Many people ask one and the same question: what’s behind her global appeal? And here are the possible reasons why millions of&nbsp;people adore her.</p><p><h2>She’s a&nbsp;real business shark, who’s been in&nbsp;the industry for a&nbsp;long time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a43/e10/6d8d935a709e2eb50d86f39913.jpg><p>While it&nbsp;may seem that Taylor Swift instantly gained her fame just “out of&nbsp;the blue,” this opinion is&nbsp;not quite realistic. The singer has actually been in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>business</a> for quite a&nbsp;long time. When she was just 10&nbsp;years old, she already decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;songwriter. When she turned&nbsp;13, she was offered a&nbsp;deal by&nbsp;an&nbsp;agency that’s a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Sony Music. At&nbsp;14, she insisted that she and her parents, who have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with music, move from Pennsylvania to&nbsp;Nashville. By&nbsp;this move, she wanted them to&nbsp;help her move forward with her music. She didn’t stop at&nbsp;this point, and in&nbsp;2005, she caught the attention of&nbsp;Big Machine Records’ chief, and at&nbsp;only 16&nbsp;years old, she finally released her debut album. Since then, she has had ten successful albums released, countless awards picked&nbsp;up, and she can boast of&nbsp;having 12&nbsp;Grammys from 46&nbsp;nominations.</p><p><h2>She’s never tired of&nbsp;trying new things, and not afraid of&nbsp;failures.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ed/cc4/2d5695572b878cf6d735dc92c1.jpg><p>Taylor Swift doesn’t belong to&nbsp;only one music genre, and her music <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>embraces</a> generations. According to&nbsp;Jody Rosen from New York Magazine, she’s the world’s biggest pop star, and her stardom actually breaks all patterns that had been established before. According to&nbsp;Rosen, Taylor falls between different genres, eras, ages, and trends. Due to&nbsp;the diversity of&nbsp;her art, she’s believed to&nbsp;have left superstars like Beyoncé, <a href=# title="Justin Bieber" data-link=tag>Justin Bieber</a>, <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a>, <a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a>, <a href=# title="Katy Perry" data-link=tag>Katy Perry</a>, and <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus" data-link=tag>Miley Cyrus</a> battling for second place. She started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;country star in&nbsp;the 2010s decade, and by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;it&nbsp;she transformed into an&nbsp;all-time musical giant.</p><p>She has a&nbsp;good <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>set of&nbsp;qualities</a> for success. Her work ethic, marketing gift, business instincts, and determination all play a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;her worldwide fame. But most frequently, she’s defined as&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent songwriter. According to&nbsp;various critics, her main gift is&nbsp;for melody, and she has a&nbsp;good sense of&nbsp;how words fit together.</p><p><h2>She has a&nbsp;special attitude to&nbsp;her fans, and they pay her back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f60/998/9256ea50e088d56b975dfc96ca.jpg><p>Taylor Swift is&nbsp;known for sharing a&nbsp;very close and warm connection with her fans. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>handpicks</a> fans for so-called “secret sessions” before each of&nbsp;her albums gets released. They’re often held in&nbsp;her own house. She also hosts many post-show meet and greets, and over the past 16&nbsp;years, the singer has built a&nbsp;strong image of&nbsp;her mutual friendship with her admirers. Taylor even remembers facts about each of&nbsp;her fans who attend her secret sessions and often surprises them by&nbsp;complimenting their new haircuts, studying achievements, and relationship details.</p><p>The singer also sends her fans surprise gifts by&nbsp;mail; they may be&nbsp;handwritten letters of&nbsp;support or&nbsp;even gift boxes that she fills in&nbsp;with the objects that, as&nbsp;she says, “remind her” of&nbsp;the fan in&nbsp;question.</p><p>Her fans, in&nbsp;return, pay back to&nbsp;their icon by&nbsp;being extra-loyal to&nbsp;Taylor. During one of&nbsp;her tours at&nbsp;Lumen Field, her fans were dancing so&nbsp;enthusiastically that they caused seismic activity equivalent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2.3</a> magnitude earthquake, as&nbsp;said by&nbsp;a&nbsp;seismologist. Some of&nbsp;her fans wear <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adult diapers</a> to&nbsp;her shows to&nbsp;avoid missing anything. In&nbsp;this way, Taylor’s fans do&nbsp;everything to&nbsp;show their love to&nbsp;their admired singer.</p><p><h2>Her songs reflect her life and have many surprising twists.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/140/d7a/58d0c05cdd9bf686aa8886fdd0.jpg><p>Taylor Swift has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with many well-known stars: <a href=# title="Harry Styles" data-link=tag>Harry Styles</a>, Tom Hiddleston, Calvin Harris, Matty Healy, and <a href=# title="Jake Gyllenhaal" data-link=tag>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. The star has even complained once that she’s gotten overwhelming media attention because of&nbsp;her private life. She’s even been described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“psycho serial dater.” But the iconic singer chose to&nbsp;play with this private fame, and now she’s feeding her fans clues about her life, which are known as&nbsp;“Easter eggs.” They’re everywhere: in&nbsp;her lyrics, liner notes, and even video clips.</p><p>People are vividly discussing which song is&nbsp;about which person from Taylor’s life or&nbsp;which celebrity scandals some of&nbsp;her songs cover. Taylor has a&nbsp;new wave of&nbsp;rumors over her blossoming romance with American Football star Travis Kelce. Their love <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> recently hit the headlines when Taylor was spotted with Travis’ mother at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his games.</p><p><h2>Taylor is&nbsp;good at&nbsp;managing her finance.</h2></p><p>Taylor Swift’s Eras tour has made an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enormous</a> amount of&nbsp;money. The movie version is&nbsp;now the hottest at&nbsp;the box office. And in&nbsp;2023, she’s entered into the status of&nbsp;a&nbsp;billionaire. She’s always been famous not only for her songs but also for her attitude to&nbsp;the financial side of&nbsp;the business. In&nbsp;2014, she withdrew her entire catalog from Spotify, protesting against the streaming service’s low payouts. She kept this boycott for almost three years, saying that valuable things should be&nbsp;decently paid for.</p><p>After the rights to&nbsp;her six albums were sold, against her will, Taylor chose to&nbsp;re-record her songs. These new versions now even outsell the originals. Bloomberg estimated that Taylor’s shows in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US this year added about $4.6 billion to&nbsp;the economy. The impact was in&nbsp;travel, hospitality, and other costs, and it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;big that it&nbsp;had been given a&nbsp;nickname, “Swiftonomics.”</p><p>And here’s another story about a&nbsp;fashion icon Adele, who asked her fans not to&nbsp;follow her <a href=#>role model</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYytn55lp528rbGMsKarpJRitrR5yKdkpaemmnq4tdOhZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF1tfneDl21m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
