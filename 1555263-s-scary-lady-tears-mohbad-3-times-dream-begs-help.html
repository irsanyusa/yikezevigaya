"Three days ago, I dreamt that I was inside a room, I saw Mohbad in the room, when I saw him he was looking at me. Cause I recognized him in the dream, I asked him wattsup, tell me what happened to you he was just looking at me, he couldn’t talk. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/be1d833c520a01bd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Chioma and I were shaking”: Davido shares testimony about his twins in emotional video, fans react</span></p></a>"I told him, tell me what happened, I promise to tell everyone but he couldn’t talk. What looked like the next day I still saw him in that same room, the room was looking so scattered not like that if a celebrity. I asked him to tell me what happened, he didn’t talk so I stretched out my hand and he held my hand and told me to come back the next day that he will tell me what happened. "The next day as I was going, I saw one aunty and she entered where Mohbad was and I was standing outside. The Aunty greeted Mohbad and Mohbad greeted her and smiled which means he knows the Aunty very well, when I now entered before I could enter the Aunty shouted something in Yoruba, Mohbad fell and was shaking. "The Aunty just left the and I met Mohbad and asked him to stand up before I knew it, he disappeared. The next day I still dreamt about him. I was not even thinking about him.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6873c0a602a98d21.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wizkid gives emotional speech at mum’s burial: “This is the deepest pain I’ve ever felt in my life”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When <strong>Legit.ng </strong>contacted her, she confirmed that she had been dreaming about the singer and all efforts to stop it from recurring proved futile.</p><p class=align-left>In her words:</p>"Different weird dreams.
