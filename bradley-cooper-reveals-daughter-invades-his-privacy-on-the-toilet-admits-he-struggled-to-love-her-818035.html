In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the famous actor talked about his special relationship with his 6-year-old daughter and revealed some details that made some people raise their eyebrows. One of&nbsp;them included him sharing the bathroom with her at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p><h2>Dax and Bradley talked about their lives as&nbsp;fathers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f18/be2/6bfe975ff39162cf7f091c4d15.jpg><p>In&nbsp;parenting, every family has its unique dynamics and quirks. On&nbsp;Dax Shepherd’s popular podcast, he&nbsp;and Bradley engaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthearted yet revealing discussion about their unique fatherhood experiences. Their conversation peeled back the curtain on&nbsp;their private lives and caused quite a&nbsp;stir on&nbsp;the internet.</p><p>Dax, an&nbsp;actor, and <a href=# title="Kristen Bell" data-link=tag>Kristen Bell</a>’s husband, shared an&nbsp;amusing aspect of&nbsp;his life at&nbsp;home. He&nbsp;described how his daughters habitually stroll into the bathroom for a&nbsp;chat. Sometimes also while he’s in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;him using the toilet. They would stand <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;foot</a> away from him, not bothered by&nbsp;the smell, he&nbsp;explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d33/447/19098a558286ff611d22aba062.jpg><p><h2>Bradley revealed he&nbsp;also experiences the same.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e4/23e/4972dc5bc993cad85ea0cbdab8.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News<span>, </span>Jordan Strauss/Invision/East News</p><p>Bradley Cooper echoed Dax’s experiences but with a&nbsp;twist unique to&nbsp;his urban dwelling. He&nbsp;shared that his home in&nbsp;New York lacks the traditional separation of&nbsp;rooms. Instead, it&nbsp;features an&nbsp;open-plan design where the bedroom, bathroom, and living area coexist without barriers. Due to&nbsp;this, his privacy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;concept that’s as&nbsp;open as&nbsp;his floor plan.</p><p>His 6-year-old daughter who lives with him is&nbsp;unfazed by&nbsp;this. She often engages in&nbsp;conversations with him, and they don’t mind sharing the bathroom. They chat when he’s on&nbsp;the toilet, and she’s in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bathtub</a>, the actor confessed. Both actors bonded on&nbsp;the fact that they let their daughters watch them <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>poop</a>.</p><p><h2>Bradley added that his upbringing was really different, but he&nbsp;didn’t mind being naked around his dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e1/21f/50bd575a3eaaad3c40c6d1f6ea.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Shepard brought up&nbsp;an&nbsp;intriguing point about whether our comfort with certain things, like not minding nudity, is&nbsp;something we’re born with or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s learned from our environment. He&nbsp;finds it&nbsp;surprising that some people, including kids, are completely okay with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The conversation took a&nbsp;turn towards reflection when Bradley contrasted his current open lifestyle with his more conservative upbringing. He&nbsp;mused over the fact that he&nbsp;never witnessed such openness in&nbsp;his own childhood. He&nbsp;noted that he&nbsp;never saw his dad on&nbsp;the toilet until he&nbsp;got sick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24b/815/991a1359cca2076c785427d528.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p><h2>Shepherd says his family rarely puts on&nbsp;clothes at&nbsp;home.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e4/b32/53c0ff547bb6bcbe8b3e21ae84.jpg><p>Shepard, on&nbsp;the other hand, mentioned that in&nbsp;his home, they have a&nbsp;very open attitude towards nudity. He&nbsp;describes it&nbsp;as&nbsp;«<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Swedish style</a>,» which means being unclothed is&nbsp;normal for them. Cooper agreed, saying he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;similar experience with his dad, who was always comfortable being naked and even took showers with him. Shepard noted that Cooper seems very at&nbsp;ease with being naked, to&nbsp;which Cooper agreed without hesitation, affirming that he’s indeed comfortable with&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Bradley admitted he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;love his daughter initially.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/954/662/66e32d5424ab983e596c6ff14f.jpg><p>Fernando Allende/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News</p><p>Bradley confessed to&nbsp;his initial uncertainty regarding his feelings for his newborn daughter. He&nbsp;confessed that before the arrival of&nbsp;his daughter with his former partner Irina Shayk in&nbsp;2017, he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;the common parental sentiment of&nbsp;being willing to&nbsp;sacrifice one’s life for their child. He&nbsp;candidly admitted that for the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eight months</a>, he&nbsp;questioned whether he&nbsp;really loved her.</p><p>But he&nbsp;says it&nbsp;all changed when he&nbsp;watched her grow, and he&nbsp;cherished the responsibility of&nbsp;caring for her. However, he&nbsp;pondered whether he&nbsp;would risk his life for her if&nbsp;faced with danger. It&nbsp;was only after a&nbsp;sudden shift in&nbsp;his emotions and outlook that he&nbsp;became certain of&nbsp;his willingness to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything for her.</p><p>Another celebrity who caused a&nbsp;stir with their parenting style is&nbsp;<a href=# title="Alicia Silverstone" data-link=tag>Alicia Silverstone</a>. She admitted to&nbsp;still sleeping with her 11-year-old son.
