Insurance companies have such agents, and street car companies, railroads, taxicab systems.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All cities have their claim agents and ambulance chasers. New York has most. After an accident they scamper to the injured person’s door, clamoring to save or earn a few dollars. Their practice is against public welfare. Bar associations, medical associations, the courts, good citizens everywhere have denounced both chasers and agents—futilely.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">New York recently arrested several dozen chasers and their lawyer employers. But the arrests did not improve conditions. The State Supreme Court decided to see what might be done. It appointed one of its justices, Isador Wasservogel, to investigate and make recommendations. Last week he did do, recommending that 74 members of the New York bar be disciplined. Summarized, his cogent suggestions were:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawyers should get no more than one third of personal injury damages won. (Usually they demand one half.) The court should supervise the fee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The court should know just how the lawyer got his case. (Ethically the clientshould go to the lawyer, not the lawyer chase the client.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To eliminate false claims, the court should verify the complaint, the bill of particulars and the defendant’s answer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perjury should be made a misdemeanor instead of a felony to insure more convictions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawyers should pay over moneys collected for clients within ten days after receipt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawyers should preserve papers and records for five years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Excluded from evidence should be all statements taken from injured persons by insurance company investigators while in a hospital, or within 15 days after an accident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Compensation insurance should be established for persons injured in automobile accidents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The court should closely supervise the interests of minor plaintiffs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Physicians who offend ethics by close co-operation with ambulance chasing lawyers should have their licenses revoked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tb2pkZ4JwucSdoJyhnpp6ornBrqOappOaeqS0wKycq6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
