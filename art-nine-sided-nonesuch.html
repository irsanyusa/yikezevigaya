Temple, a mélange of ancient styles sparkling with tons of white quartz crystals, was newly completed after eleven years’ labor. Nine-sided, it stands in a nine-acre park, is supported by nine concrete piers sunk 90 feet below the water level of nearby Lake Michigan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nine is of great significance in the Bahá’i religion (TIME, July 20, 1931), because it is the final digit. The Bahá’i faith—boasting 29 adherents in Wilmette, 3,000 in the U.S., and more than 1,000,000 in the world—was founded in Persia in 1863 by one Mirzá Husayn-‘Ali, who took the name of Bahá’u’lláh (Glory of God). His followers emphasize the unity of mankind, universal peace, abolishment of extreme inequalities of wealth, and a world faith absorbing all religions now extant. Prominent Bahá’is include Mrs. Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, wife of New York’s onetime lieutenant governor. The Wilmette Temple’s nine sides symbolize the world’s nine chief religions, but not all Bahá’is agree as to what those religions are. Among the religious symbols in the Temple are the swastika, the circle, the triangle, the Jewish six-pointed star, the Greek and Roman Cross.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Permission from Palestine. Permission to erect a Bahá’i House of Worship “in the center of the Western World” was received from Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh’s son, in 1902. The fact that there were very few Bahá’is in the U.S. at that time made the project seem overbold. But by 1912 the Temple’s site had been bought, and blessed by Abdu’l-Bahá himself. Cried he: “Now praise be to God that Chicago and its environs, from the beginning of the diffusion of the Fragrances of God, have been a strong heart.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1920 a competition for the Temple’s design was won by the late New Jersey architect Louis Bourgeois, a Bahá’i believer. Bourgeois took ship to the Holy Land, showed Abdu’l-Bahá his drawings. Abdu’l-Bahá approved and set the building’s cost at $1,000,000 (cost to date: $1,000,342).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bourgeois got Washington’s architectural sculptor John J. Earley to do the external ornamentation. Bourgeois did not live to see the results: he died in 1930, on the Temple grounds. Wrote he of the shrine: “It is too sacred to me to try to utter words about it. . . . Most people who appreciate this ‘new art’ look to me as the creator of it, but the One Who did it, they do not know—that One was the Blessed Perfection, Bahá’u’lláh.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vb25haX5wrdGtZKehnpp6tLXDnptmpp%2BjsrTBwqFm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
