By Constance Keane Detlie, 23, wheat-headed cinemactress “Veronica Lake”; Army Major John Stewart Detlie, 34, peacetime cinema art director; three years after their marriage (for each the first), three months after the death of their premature second child; in Hollywood. She charged that his treatment of her had “produced a condition detrimental to her health and welfare.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Benjamin Anzelevitz, 52, “Ben Bernie, the O-O-Old Maestro,” genial, plush-voiced veteran of stage, radio, screen; of a lung infection with heart complications ; in Beverly Hills. An East Side New York blacksmith’s son, at 15 he gave a violin recital in Carnegie Hall, took up engineering after hearing Mischa Elman’s debut.* In a Brauhaus he played his way through college, finally landed in vaudeville as “Ben, The Eccentric Violinist.” In the early ’20s he formed one of the country’s leading dance bands (for a while his pianist was Oscar Levant). For years he set the beat at Chicago’s College Inn and Manhattan’s Roosevelt Grill. On the radio his pseudo-feuding with Walter Winchell became as famous as the sign-off he gave Jan. 15 for the last time: “Au revoir, a fond cheerio, a bit of toodle-oo, God bless you, and pleas—ant dreams.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Admiral Sir Alfred Dudley Pickman Rogers Pound, 66, Britain’s First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff from May 1939 to last Oct. 4; some six weeks after being taken ill while returning from the Quebec Conference; in London. Son of an English lawyer and Boston-born mother, cock-hatted, hawk-faced Sir Dudley commanded a man-of-war at Jutland, later helped set up Britain’s convoy system. In World War II he brilliantly organized supplies, blockades.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Felix Philip Vaccaro, 77, youngest of New Orleans’ famed, fruit-rich Vaccaro brothers; after long illness; in New Orleans. With his brothers Joseph and the late Lucca, bull-necked Felix built a fortune of many millions on the basis of a schooner load of Honduran bananas. By the ’30s the silent Italian trio were powers in (largely Louisianian) orange groves, ships, chemicals, banks, presses, oil, ice, hotels, real estate, insurance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">* When Mischa Elman heard Jascha Heifetz’s debut, he remarked to his companion, Pianist Leopold Godowsky, that it was a hot night. Said Godowsky: “Not for pianists.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vb25kZoFwucilnKysn6OytHnNqK1maV1mhnV%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
