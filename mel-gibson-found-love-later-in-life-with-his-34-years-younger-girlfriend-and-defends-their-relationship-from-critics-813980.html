He&nbsp;met his girlfriend, Rosalind Ross, back in&nbsp;2014, and ever since, their relationship has been going great. Despite their happiness, many people still doubt their relationship because of&nbsp;their big age difference. But Mel and Ross are proving all those skeptics wrong with their strong bond.</p><p><h2>Rosalind Ross was signed to&nbsp;co-write a&nbsp;script for Mel’s company, and that’s how they met.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3b/4a9/d0dc4155718e0af7fd1c35e4ba.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>In&nbsp;2014, fate intervened when Ross found herself on&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>business</a> trip at&nbsp;Gibson’s ranch in&nbsp;Costa Rica, and that’s when their romantic journey began. After their time in&nbsp;Costa Rica, the adventurous duo, with Ross being 24&nbsp;and Mel 58&nbsp;at the time, embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic escapade to&nbsp;Panama. From that point&nbsp;on, they seemed inseparable. Ross also accompanied Gibson on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Sydney and even visited him on&nbsp;the set while he&nbsp;was filming <i>Hacksaw Ridge</i>.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2017, Rosalinda and Mel welcomed their first child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/704/248/a75e8351bbaab9231c3434d73c.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Despite already having 8&nbsp;children&nbsp;— 7&nbsp;with his ex-wife Robyn and 1&nbsp;with his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva&nbsp;— Mel Gibson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expanded</a> his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> further by&nbsp;welcoming a&nbsp;son with Ross.
