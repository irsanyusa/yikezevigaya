They’re even on&nbsp;the menu of&nbsp;school lunches. What if&nbsp;I tell you that they aren’t actually made entirely out of&nbsp;chicken? Researchers took chicken nugget samples from unnamed fast-food chains and analyzed them. They said that one sample, for example, contained only&nbsp;40% and another&nbsp;50% of&nbsp;meat. The rest? Well, you’re eating mouthfuls of&nbsp;things like fat, connective tissue, and bone spicules. Many fast food companies grind the meat with that stuff. They make mechanically formed orbs of&nbsp;chicken parts. Why? Perhaps it’s because this method is&nbsp;cheaper and more profitable. Millions of&nbsp;restaurants worldwide have chicken nuggets on&nbsp;their menu. So, scientifically, it’s not fair to&nbsp;say all nuggets are made this way, but a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;studies imply&nbsp;so.</p><p>The more the meat is&nbsp;processed, the more you lose the good stuff like Vitamin B6&nbsp;and B12. The bitter truth is&nbsp;that companies add stuff, such as&nbsp;sodium, to&nbsp;the mixed paste. Sodium is&nbsp;added to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better flavor. It’s one of&nbsp;the ingredients that makes nuggets so&nbsp;yummy. Our body needs sodium, but not too much of&nbsp;it. Unfortunately, most junk food contains more than our bodies can handle. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe option to&nbsp;avoid eating these sorts of&nbsp;food frequently. Chains dip their nuggets into tempura batter and fry them in&nbsp;hydrogenated oil. That’s also not a&nbsp;green light regarding <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>, but this is&nbsp;how they catch the golden tint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5cf/b03/dac846517e9320681b4c1b21ca.png><p>They put additional stuff in&nbsp;nuggets; what about grilled chicken? In&nbsp;recent years, we&nbsp;have seen brands highlighting grilled chicken as&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthier option. Research has been done about grilled chicken, too. And the same approach is&nbsp;applied here. Take chicken samples from iconic fast food companies and send those to&nbsp;labs for analysis. The results show that companies are misleading people by&nbsp;advertising these products by&nbsp;labeling them healthy, natural, and 100% chicken breast. In&nbsp;reality, a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;things are added to&nbsp;the meat to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;tender and juicy. Plus, these additives make it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;cook the meat, freeze and transport&nbsp;it, and reheat it&nbsp;later without losing too much moisture. The drawback of&nbsp;all these additives is&nbsp;that they affect the nutritional value of&nbsp;the chicken breast.</p><p>These ingredients aren’t the healthiest for&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;should especially watch out for 3&nbsp;things. The first one is&nbsp;again sodium. Fast food samples had 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;times more sodium than home-cooked chicken breast! Imagine you crave a&nbsp;cheeseburger, but you say “no” to&nbsp;yourself and try to&nbsp;pick a&nbsp;less “harmful” menu. Yet, some chicken sandwiches have the same amount or&nbsp;even more sodium than a&nbsp;cheeseburger with medium fries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a97/dfc/b337e8523eb842c73309a45cf6.png><p>The second thing you need to&nbsp;watch out for is&nbsp;phosphate additives. These additives allow the protein to&nbsp;conjoin more water. This means the white meat in&nbsp;the sandwich will appear juicier to&nbsp;you. Any word you see in&nbsp;the ingredients section that contains “phos” is&nbsp;a&nbsp;phosphate additive, so&nbsp;it’s best to&nbsp;avoid them. The last thing you should avoid is&nbsp;sugars and starches, not just in&nbsp;grilled chicken but pretty much in&nbsp;all fast food products. Oh, that’s hard to&nbsp;“digest,” I&nbsp;admit. Corn starch, sugar, malt... they come with grilled chicken breast. Buns and even some fries have sugar, too. Everywhere I&nbsp;look, it’s sugar. You see, home-cooked chicken has 0&nbsp;grams of&nbsp;carbs. But the study samples had added sugar, and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;the calories in&nbsp;the chicken breast comes from there. So&nbsp;what’s the moral of&nbsp;this story? If&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;health-conscious diner, you should maybe go&nbsp;for other options.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8dd/0d4/9ad11f5cd9a2f02cf69096aa3f.png><p>There are secret recipes from companies like KFC and Coca-Cola. No&nbsp;company wants to&nbsp;share the ingredients that make their food irresistible, but with a&nbsp;little research, you can decipher many things. You wanna know the secret of&nbsp;McDonald’s fries? It’s written on&nbsp;their website. They add beef flavoring to&nbsp;the frying oil. This may sound weird, but apparently, that’s a&nbsp;known practice amongst chefs and restaurants. Duck fat has also been used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;flavor, for example, in&nbsp;high-end restaurants.</p><p>I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;fries lover, so&nbsp;I added another fact about fries. Sadly, they are even saltier than you think. Experts suggest that a&nbsp;grown-up should consume at&nbsp;most 2,300 milligrams of&nbsp;sodium daily. Guess the McD’s large fries sodium number. At&nbsp;least 400&nbsp;milligrams. Classic fries from Burger King have 732&nbsp;milligrams, and Five Guys take the level even higher with 962 milligrams of&nbsp;sodium! Next time, maybe you can ask workers to&nbsp;go&nbsp;easy on&nbsp;the salt as&nbsp;a&nbsp;solution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fb5/a76/96ea5b5ed79f5668feeb884973.png><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;know how clean an&nbsp;eatery&nbsp;is, look under the ice chute of&nbsp;the soda machine in&nbsp;places where you can get your own drink. There you&nbsp;go, inspector. You’ve solved the case. Various studies say that if&nbsp;such machines aren’t cleaned correctly, dirty, contaminated ice can lead to&nbsp;some health problems. There could be&nbsp;mold or&nbsp;bacteria there. Eww... The process of&nbsp;cleaning ice machines isn’t easy. The same thing applies to&nbsp;ice cream machines too. Rumor has it&nbsp;that those ice cream machines aren’t out of&nbsp;order; employers just cannot find time to&nbsp;clean them properly.</p><p>Now, what’s the best time to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;good and fresh meal? Here, there are 2&nbsp;opinions, and they both have solid reasonings. The first team recommends avoiding ordering grilled food in&nbsp;chains from 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;after midnight. Many former employees say that sometimes, they had taquitos or&nbsp;hotdogs prepared at&nbsp;around 4&nbsp;or 5&nbsp;AM but kept waiting to&nbsp;serve them till around midnight. That’s not healthy. The other team says you should order between 11&nbsp;AM and 1&nbsp;PM or&nbsp;between 6&nbsp;PM and 8&nbsp;PM to&nbsp;get the freshest meal. Since it’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around lunch and dinner time, there’ll be&nbsp;circulation, and you can get decent food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fd1/177/02e2695ac5b2d1f159f585e470.png><p>Fast food companies have marketing, <a href=# title=design data-link=tag>design</a>, and psychological tricks to&nbsp;lure you in&nbsp;and make you order. Yet, they don’t want you to&nbsp;stay inside for too long. If&nbsp;you were dining in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mood lighting, you know, under dim lamps and candlelight, you would take your time to&nbsp;eat. As&nbsp;the name suggests, you should be&nbsp;fast like your food in&nbsp;chain restaurants. They have fluorescents, and they’re in&nbsp;full light. Similarly, the floors and tables have reflective surfaces that make food look nice and bright. Plus, music is&nbsp;usually fast and loud. It’s done to&nbsp;prevent you from spending hours there. Yet, they want to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;the first 20&nbsp;minutes after your purchase. The faster you eat, the longer it&nbsp;will take you to&nbsp;feel full. Scientists say it&nbsp;takes about 20&nbsp;minutes for our stomach to&nbsp;inform our brain, “Okay, now I’m full!”</p><p>It’s good to&nbsp;eat in&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean area, but most of&nbsp;these companies use cleaning products that have super-strong chemicals. Assume that the staff cleaned the place at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;their shift. They wiped down the soda machine and grill surface, and then you showed up&nbsp;early the next day. You may get some of&nbsp;that chemical residue on&nbsp;your food compared to&nbsp;other customers visiting the place later in&nbsp;the day.</p><p>The vegan patty may not be&nbsp;100% vegan. I’m talking about the grill, not the meat itself. In&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the chains, vegan burgers are cooked on&nbsp;the same grill as&nbsp;meat burgers.
