And when <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>John C. McGinley</a>’s first kid was born with <a href=# title="Down syndrome" data-link=tag>Down syndrome</a>, the loving dad decided to&nbsp;transform his career and life path just for his little boy. After all, parenthood is&nbsp;the most selfless journey we&nbsp;can go&nbsp;on, and this actor’s story proves that family will always come first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da0/0d5/095e64517bbd8eaf18b22df241.jpg><p>Actor John C. McGinley had become a&nbsp;familiar face to&nbsp;us for many years with roles in&nbsp;award-winning hits like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Platoon</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Se7en</i></a>. And it&nbsp;was watching him regularly for 9&nbsp;years as&nbsp;Dr. Perry Cox, one of&nbsp;the main characters in&nbsp;the popular sitcom,<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scrubs</i></a>, that made&nbsp;us feel even closer to&nbsp;him. But despite having a&nbsp;successful acting career, it&nbsp;was back at&nbsp;home that John found his biggest and most rewarding role.</p><p>The actor became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dad</a> for the first time at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;38&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby boy named Max. And it&nbsp;was only on&nbsp;August&nbsp;31, 1997, the very day Max was born, that he&nbsp;and his now ex-wife found out that their son had Down syndrome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c3/20f/79a8f751388d4f76e8611b61af.jpg><p>In&nbsp;fact, John <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that the couple didn’t have amniocentesis, as&nbsp;both were in&nbsp;good shape and had no&nbsp;history of&nbsp;challenges in&nbsp;their families, plus they were told that the fetus was very healthy. And this is&nbsp;what made the news about their son’s condition very unexpected.</p><p>The now 63-year-old actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that back then he&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;clue about Down syndrome, and his journey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;new dad was very complicated at&nbsp;the beginning. He&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;about feeling ’’crazy blame’’ because he&nbsp;wondered what he&nbsp;could’ve done wrong that caused his son to&nbsp;be&nbsp;born with an&nbsp;extra chromosome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f3/01f/750bbf55eb9148d7dccfc6ba34.jpg><p>However, the doting father wasn’t about to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;his baby boy. On&nbsp;the contrary, he&nbsp;was fully determined to&nbsp;find out every little thing about Down syndrome so&nbsp;that Max grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the best conditions possible. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>year off</a> from acting, started to&nbsp;attend seminars, and read everything he&nbsp;could find on&nbsp;the subject.</p><p>And fast forward to&nbsp;today&nbsp;— John is&nbsp;still not choosing to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>busy</a> taking care of&nbsp;Max and his 2&nbsp;younger daughters as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;serving on&nbsp;the board of&nbsp;the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abc/3f2/8fb1415c4f883041e585c1ce77.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, his involvement with Down syndrome didn’t just stop at&nbsp;Max’s well-being. For years now, the doting dad has been an&nbsp;international <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spokesperson</a> for Down syndrome and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>works</a> to&nbsp;raise awareness about it&nbsp;and promoting better opportunities for people with disabilities.</p><p>The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that he&nbsp;didn’t want his involvement to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the surface, and instead he&nbsp;aimed for a ’’more proactive’’ approach. This includes being a&nbsp;part of ’’the single biggest fundraiser for people with down syndrome,’’ which involves the support of&nbsp;other celebrities. John also devotes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;his personal time and energy to&nbsp;other kids born with Down syndrome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/189/52e/6ec65d5b93ba185c4153723472.jpg><p>Today, Max is&nbsp;25&nbsp;years old and seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;living his best life. The proud father <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, ’’Max is&nbsp;healthy and fantastic. He’s got a&nbsp;job at&nbsp;Starbucks, he&nbsp;plays in&nbsp;a&nbsp;band, and has a&nbsp;concert in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks.’’ He&nbsp;added, ’’He’s in&nbsp;great shape right now."</p><p>After all, this is&nbsp;what John wanted for his son from the day he&nbsp;was born, and it&nbsp;seems that thanks to&nbsp;his utter devotion and limitless fatherly love, he&nbsp;made his life goal a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;John C. McGinley’s journey through fatherhood? Do&nbsp;you agree that nothing can be&nbsp;more constructive for a&nbsp;child than a&nbsp;parent’s unconditional love?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yjpqGmXZh6rq%2FGoqWlnamoeq271Z5kn6eiYrWqv4yspqdlnZaxpnnHoqRmq6SavW6t1pqwZp6ipLpurcKtoKefXZa7pXnDnq2orJVitaq%2FjKWgn51dqbxut8idqmavmam1brDOsKVmq6mjsbO7zJ5kcWhpaIBxew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
