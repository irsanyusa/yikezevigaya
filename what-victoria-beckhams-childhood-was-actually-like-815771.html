David peeped out from behind the door and interrupted his wife, confronting her about what her <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> was actually like. The clip appeared on&nbsp;social media, and it&nbsp;didn’t take long for people to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;go&nbsp;viral.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;documentary about David came out on&nbsp;Netflix.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f98/314/96c0b95a3692750930950eeb5c.png><p>A&nbsp;documentary about David Beckham’s life was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>released</a> on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Netflix data-link=tag>Netflix</a>. The film director Fisher Stevens told the story of&nbsp;the famous footballer&nbsp;— from the star’s career to&nbsp;his private life. Stevens <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that spending 30&nbsp;hours interviewing David had felt like being a&nbsp;therapist.</p><p>The series is&nbsp;divided into 4&nbsp;parts. It&nbsp;covers such important moments of&nbsp;Beckham’s life as&nbsp;leaving the working class, meeting Victoria, and the relationship with his Manchester United manager.</p><p><h2>Victoria claimed her family was working class.</h2></p><p>The documentary wouldn’t be&nbsp;complete if&nbsp;Victoria hadn’t got some screen time. The star was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interviewed</a> in&nbsp;the documentary as&nbsp;well.</p><p>She was telling some details about her childhood. Apparently, wanting to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;story that would prove how far she’s come. Victoria told the off-camera interviewer, “We&nbsp;were very, very working class”.</p><p><h2>David interrupted her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/466/509/e81d2e5825b6c6cc71169280b8.jpg><p>David peeped out from behind the door and playfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Be&nbsp;honest!”. Victoria replied, “I&nbsp;am honest!” Yet, David insisted that she tell the truth. Victoria refused to&nbsp;back down, saying, “I&nbsp;am being honest”</p><p>Then David asked a&nbsp;tricky question, “What car did your dad drive you to&nbsp;school&nbsp;in?” Victoria tried to&nbsp;avoid answering&nbsp;it, but David kept asking. Finally, she gave in&nbsp;and said, “In&nbsp;the 80s, my&nbsp;dad had a&nbsp;Rolls-Royce.”</p><p><h2>People praise him for that.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62e/9e0/b1ac345996a3e03f0d8561e952.jpg><p>Once the clip <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> on&nbsp;social media, it&nbsp;didn’t take long for users to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;go&nbsp;viral. Many were making jokes about how David playfully interrupted Victoria. They praised his honesty and sense of&nbsp;humor.</p><p>Others were quite indignant about the fact that she pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“working class”. However, some fans suspect that this unexpected “twist” was intentional and was aimed at&nbsp;making the documentary more popular.</p><p><h2>Victoria’s childhood wasn’t an&nbsp;unhappy one.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/754/03e/6299e85a988703621b6566c4db.jpg><p>The star is&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Posh</a> Spice since she was a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;Spice Girls. In&nbsp;fact, she was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;upper-middle-class family. Her father, Anthony Adams, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;electronic engineer and her mother, Jacqueline, was an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insurance</a> clerk and a&nbsp;hairdresser. Victoria grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;comfort as&nbsp;her parents owned an&nbsp;electronics wholesale business.</p><p>Her parents encouraged her to&nbsp;study acting, music, dancing, and modelling. The star was embarrassed of&nbsp;her family’s wealth and often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> her father not to&nbsp;drive her to&nbsp;school in&nbsp;the Rolls-Royce.</p><p>We&nbsp;have some more stories about the famous family. In&nbsp;<a href=#>this article</a>, Victoria admits David has never seen her without her eyebrows&nbsp;on, despite being married for 24&nbsp;years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmraKbpKS%2Fqq2Mm5yco5iWurR5wqGgpZyYpLyledaaqmaZk6nCorjLsmSloZuaenl9lHBuamc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
