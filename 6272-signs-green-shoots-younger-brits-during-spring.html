That remains the case, with people in the capital scoring 114 and those with household income of £50,000 and above also scoring 114.</p><p>However, this month I want to focus on another group whose increased positivity is particularly encouraging – the young.</p><p>The 18-34 year-old age group have always been more positive than their older counterparts and in May they increased by four points to 112, touching heights not seen since March 2010.</p><p>Job security among young people has been particularly bolstered in the past month. The number of people who think their job is more secure than a month ago has reached its highest level since YouGov started collecting data in 2009 and the score now stands at 103, meaning for the first time since we started collecting the data more 18-34 year-olds are positive than negative about their job security.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/050613-HEAT-May-young-people.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>So more good news on economic confidence. After so long talking about lack of progress it is a pleasure to be sounding positive again. Let us hope that the trajectory of the trend line continues to be upwards.</p><p><a href=#>This article originally appeared in City AM</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZmeEc3nSop6nq12cv6axzWaqoaefqcBuxc6upaCdomKvs7XTrGSdraKeu6h50qmpoqaX</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
