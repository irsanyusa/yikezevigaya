His net approval rating among PRI supporters — the share who approve of his job performance minus the share who disapprove — declined 36 percentage points.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Some of the steepest declines came among young people, a worrying trend for López Obrador in a country with a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>median age of 29</a> in 2020. The president’s net approval rating among Mexicans between ages 18-34 and 35-44 declined 11 points and 17 points, respectively.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Aside from Morena supporters, López Obrador still boasts strong support from low-income Mexicans he claims to champion, but even there he has lost some shine: His net approval rating among Mexicans who earn less than 7,499 pesos ($395) per month declined 13 points.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Why Mexicans have rallied around the INE</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">López Obrador has held a grudge against the INE since his close loss in the 2006 presidential election to Felipe Calderón, which he has claimed was fraudulently decided. Nevertheless, it is one of the few institutions that can rival the president’s popularity, as many Mexicans remember the days of single-party rule. For decades, the PRI-dominated Interior Ministry manipulated election results to ensure control, epitomized by the alleged computer crash that stopped vote-counting in the 1988 elections.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The INE’s independence has been lauded by the international community for consistently delivering free and fair elections since 2000 despite mounting challenges. López Obrador’s overhaul will cut the institution’s budget and centralize control over appointments to key positions, which critics say will give the powers that be in Mexico City effective control.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOppyxoZOWu2680Z6qopyVo8Furc%2BpqaiukaF6s63ToqWgZZykvabGjKiZq5mUpL9utc2e</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
