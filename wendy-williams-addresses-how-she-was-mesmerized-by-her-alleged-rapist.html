The 56-year-old television host opened up about her date rape and sexual assault allegations against late R&B singer Sherrick.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wendy-williams-opened-up-about-rape-allegations-that-happened-in-the-80s>Wendy Williams Opened Up About Rape Allegations That Happened In The 80s</h2><p>“He mesmerized me with his twinkling eyes,” she said about meeting Sherrick back in the 80s. Wendy first started off her career as a popular radio personality years before transitioning to host of The Wendy Williams Show. “He flipped the interview around to where he was interviewing me – I was just gaga over this man and he asked me to go to an opening party, an album release party, with him that night. And before the party, I was date raped by him.”</p><p>“Those types of things happen to girls all the time” the former ‘Masked Singer’ contestant continued. “And they’ve been happening a lot, to a lot of our mothers, grandmothers, great-great-grandmothers and their great-great-grandmothers, too.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> WENDY WILLIAMS REFLECTS ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ EXPERIENCE DAYS AFTER STRANGE ON-AIR BEHAVIOR</a></strong></p><p>Wendy further detailed her account when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to the Daily News.</a> “His name was Sherrick [and] he was a one-hit-wonder, remember the song. It was called ‘Just Call’ and it was number one on the R&B charts and an overnight sensation,” she said. “He said he wanted to shower and freshen up and introduced cocaine to the scene,” she added. “I was already familiar with cocaine so I was continuing to party while he was in the shower. And I was sitting on the bed minding my own business.” Later in the interview, she declared that she “was raped by Sherrick.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-widow-addressed-wendy-s-rape-claims>His Widow Addressed Wendy’s Rape Claims</h3><p>Sherrick’s widow, Lynne Conner Smith spoke out after hearing that the movie will address Wendy’s experience with Sherrick. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Page Six</a> that Wendy should let Sherrick “rest in peace,” because he “is not here to defend himself.” Sherrick passed away in 1999. The couple had three children together.</p><p>“The man that others knew as ‘Sherrick’ passed away 21 years ago” Lynne added. “He was loved and adored by his family and we miss him every day.&nbsp;As I will never minimize or dismiss the horrid actions of sexual assault, I am saddened that Ms. Williams feels the need to publicly make these allegations when the man she is accusing is no longer on this earth to defend himself.&nbsp;Our family does not know Ms. Williams and are not aware of any relationship or encounter they may have had.”</p><p>“Why would Wendy not call the police if it were true?” she asked.&nbsp;“Why did she go out with him?&nbsp;We have questions, too!” These questions may be answered in the upcoming movie.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-movie-will-address-wendy-s-recent-divorce>The Movie Will Address Wendy’s Recent Divorce</h3><p>In the movie, the role of Wendy will be played by Ciera Payton.

Their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce was finalized in 2020.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtl9jAAjMYY</p></figure><p>“The life that I’m living right now is my best life, and I have no guilt about saying that. I don’t regret meeting Kevin, I don’t regret falling in love, I don’t regret staying with him for all 25 years, 21 of them married” she continued during the panel.</p><p>She urged fans to watch her upcoming movie because there is a lot to be learned about her life. “I was able to clear up half-truths and untruths” she said. “Just when you think you know, you watch a biopic and you learn a whole lot more — and for mine, I wanted to be very truthful.”</p><p>Wendy previously demonstrated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>strange on-air behavior,</a> jumbling her words <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>and losing her train of thought</a> on The Wendy Williams Show. She insisted that she is fine and the long hours rehearsing for The Masked Singer were to blame and that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone has off days.</a></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH WENDY WILLIAMS EXPOSE FRIEND BLACK CHYNA FOR HAVING ‘NO PLACE TO LIVE’</a></strong></p><p>You can catch Wendy Williams: The Movie&nbsp;to get the full story of her life on Jan. 30 at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-The-Voice-Zuma-Rossdale-Blake-And-Gwen-engaged.jpg alt="WATCH Gwen Stefani’s 12-Year-Old Son Model For Her New Funky Eyewear Collection" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>wendy williams</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571p6lnbFdrLatuMiapKxlkZmxs7HSrJysZZikxG6%2Fx55ksJmjYrqmv8yeqaKylZl6o8WMoZyrZZGhuaazxJ1kq5mgnsC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
