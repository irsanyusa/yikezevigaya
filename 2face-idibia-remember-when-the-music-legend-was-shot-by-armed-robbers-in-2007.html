An attempt by 2Face to open the door the man who had a locally made gun opened fire on him. 2Face himself started shouting 'Run Run'," he explained to <strong>Ayeni Adekunle</strong> who covered the story when it broke.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Thankfully, 2face wasn't badly hurt as he had a laptop on his lap when he was shot at which prevented the bullets from penetrating deeply into his body.</p><p>After the ugly incident, 2Face was rushed to <strong>Cedar Group Hospital</strong> at <strong>Festac Town</strong> where he underwent a minor surgery to remove the 22 bullets from his thigh. This was the same hospital he was treated for his 2005 robbery attack.</p><p>At the time of the incident, 2Face was on his way to FESTAC Town from <strong>Murtala Mohammed</strong> international airport. He had just won the "<strong>Best African Act</strong>" at the 12th edition of <strong>MOBO</strong> awards in London when he was attacked by robbers.</p><p>On Monday, October 8, 2007, 2face Idibia during his recovery process spoke to the media. "I thank God. ‘Cos I know it’s not luck. The bullet could have hit me somewhere more dangerous. So I really thank God, and I’m really trying to understand what he’s trying to tell me with this incident" said 2face Idibia.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The singer further said "we didn’t know it was robbers. We even thought it was a car trying to ram into us. It was not until I saw the gun, and heard the shot that I realised what they wanted. So I told my guy, let’s find our way o… these guys mean business. I didn’t even know the bullet hit me. It was while we were running, that my left leg started failing me, that I realised what had happened."</p><p>"It’s really sad; that people would allow frustration lead them into doing such things. There are people on the road, selling stuff, trying so hard to make it. Nothing comes easy in life; you’ve just got to keep trying. I pray they’ll convert all the energy they use to organise those attacks into doing positive things that’ll help their lives."</p><p>2face Idibia spoke about the robbery incident in a private hospital because of the amount of well wishers that trooped over the weekend at the hospital in FESTAC.</p><p>Thankfully, 2face Idibia has not been attacked by robbers ever since then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZrnpGYsm61w6KZopldp7KuscybnKtlp52yr3nToZxmpaWotqR5y56enqaUYsSiv4ysn6isXZfGbq3RppydZaKkr6Ox0axkoqZdZ31xg46xaLKsm525</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
