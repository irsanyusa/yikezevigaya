After <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>18</a>&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, the couple decided to&nbsp;part ways in&nbsp;2001, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenging period of&nbsp;transition for both of&nbsp;them.</p><p>The news of&nbsp;their divorce drew attention from the media, as&nbsp;the public was captivated by&nbsp;the dissolution of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term celebrity union. The couple had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two children</a> together, Malcolm and Georgia, and their decision to&nbsp;separate undoubtedly had a&nbsp;profound impact on&nbsp;their family dynamics.</p><p>While the reasons behind their divorce remain private, the public’s curiosity fueled speculation and rumors in&nbsp;various tabloids. Ford found himself subjected to&nbsp;unwarranted scrutiny, with reports suggesting romantic entanglements with other famous individuals. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a> at&nbsp;the time, “It&nbsp;was very hurtful to&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids. It&nbsp;was hurtful to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people, because 90&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was wrong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2b/d46/52c64f5ac0ad889e35fc66e800.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2002, Harrison Ford experienced a&nbsp;fortuitous encounter at&nbsp;the Golden Globes that would change the course of&nbsp;his life. At&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when he&nbsp;was grappling with feelings of&nbsp;loneliness and in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;a&nbsp;meaningful love story, he&nbsp;crossed paths with Calista Flockhart. “There have been times in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life when&nbsp;I have felt&nbsp;I was lonely, but&nbsp;I don’t think you want to&nbsp;live your life in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;mitigate against loneliness,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>When Ford came across Calista, there was an&nbsp;undeniable and immediate connection despite their 22-year <a href=# title="age difference" data-link=tag>age difference</a>. Ford had been a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;Flockhart’s impressive portrayal of&nbsp;Ally McBeal in&nbsp;the hit&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>TV series</a>. Meanwhile, she fondly recalled Ford’s captivating performance in&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mosquito Coast</i></a>. Therefore, the shared admiration for each other’s work added an&nbsp;extra layer of&nbsp;intrigue to&nbsp;their meeting.</p><p><h2>She was a&nbsp;young single mom</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a6e/8c2/10537e5399946d2dec2fb9f9aa.jpg><p>Camille Roberts/Broadimage/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Camille Roberts/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>When they first met, Calista Flockhart had recently become a&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;her one-year-old adopted son, Liam. “She’s brought a&nbsp;child back into my&nbsp;home,” Ford <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>. “My&nbsp;youngest, other than Liam, is&nbsp;17. It’s a&nbsp;wonderful opportunity to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s growing&nbsp;up, which is&nbsp;always an&nbsp;endless springtime. You see the blossoming and the growing and the nurturing and the payoff.”</p><p>He&nbsp;acknowledged the sacrifices she had made and the love she had poured into their son’s life. With deep appreciation, Ford expressed, “She’s a&nbsp;mother by&nbsp;choice—she adopted Liam before we&nbsp;met, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single parent, which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;awesome responsibility to&nbsp;take. She’s devoted herself to&nbsp;Liam and has done a&nbsp;really wonderful job raising him.
