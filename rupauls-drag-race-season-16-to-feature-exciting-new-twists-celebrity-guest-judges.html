Mother RuPaul is fleshing out her royal court of RuPaul’s Drag Race season 16 guest judges with Oscar-winning, chart-topping, and society-influencing talent, plus a game-changing immunity twist to the show’s format.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-are-the-new-twists-in-drag-race-season-16>What’s Are The New Twists in Drag Race Season 16?</h2><p>Season 16 contestant Megami reveals that the new season will see the return of some “good old Drag Race classics” that fans have been requesting. While she remained coy on the exact details, this hint seemingly points to the reintroduction of fan-favorite challenges and formatting that have been absent in recent seasons.</p><p>One new twist that has already been teased is the “rating a queen” segment, in which the contestants themselves will rank one another’s performances to determine the top and bottom queens of the week.</p><p>Giving the competitors a direct hand in judging is sure to stir up drama, tension, and accusations of favoritism. It could reveal simmering feuds within the cast. Expect broken alliances, bitter rivalries, and maybe even a “b*tch slap or two,” according to queen Dawn.</p><p>Another major new twist involves an immunity power that will save one queen from <a href=#>elimination</a>. Details are scarce, but this ability to skirt the chopping block will surely be a hot commodity in the Werk Room. Expect backstabbing and betrayal as the queens vie for this get-out-of-jail-free card.</p><p>The winner of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> season 16 will take home a cash prize of $200,000. With that amount of money on the line, the competition promises to be more intense and cutthroat than ever before.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-season-16-features-a-star-studded-lineup-of-guest-judges>Season 16 Features a Star-Studded Lineup of Guest Judges</h2><p>In addition to RuPaul and regular panelists <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Visage</a>, Carson Kressley, Ross Matthews, and Ts Madison, season 16 boasts a truly dazzling lineup of guest judges.</p><p>Oscar-winner Charlize Theron will be making an appearance for the season premiere. She will be joined by fellow Academy Award honoree Marlee Matlin later in the season.</p><p>Other renowned actresses gracing the judges’ table include Kyra Sedgwick, Mayan Lopez, and horror-icon Sarah Michelle Gellar. Not only are these famous faces sure to excite viewers, but their seasoned acting expertise should provide invaluable advice for the queen’s theatrical challenges.</p><p>Several music superstars are also joining the guest judge panel. Pop duo Icona Pop and country singer Kelsea Ballerini will assess the queen’s musical abilities. Meanwhile, composer Adam Shankman will raise the bar for dance and choreography performances.</p><p>Famed designer Isaac Mizrahi and celebrity stylist Law Roach will also be guests who will offer invaluable fashion feedback. Rounding out the judges list are journalist Ronan Farrow and models Kaia Gerber and Becky G, providing social and runway expertise.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_BlakeShelton_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Blake Shelton Shares His New Year’s Resolution to Stop Drinking" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6tLHArKanZWFrerW7jJ%2Bcmqylp7JusdecoK2hnpx6r7HWZquwoaOpwG6vxKWcm6qZqcZus9Seqq1lmqqxqLHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
