Johnson, who plays for the team, was interviewed along with her teammates Angel Reese and Alexis Morris on The Jennifer Hudson Show.</p><p>“That was my awakening of, like, ‘Wow, you really can do this,'” Johnson said of her time on America’s Got Talent. “Like, it wasn’t a dream of me being in my bedroom rapping. It was like, ‘You can really be a star.’ Simon Cowell, he came back. He was like, ‘Flau’jae, you’re a superstar.'”</p><p>Hudson, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">competed on American Idol</a>, pointed out how difficult it is to get a comment like that from Cowell. Johnson said it gave her “the confidence I needed to keep going as an artist.”</p><p>The host then asked Johnson to share her talent with the audience. She went on to deliver part of a rap she performed on AGT: All-Stars earlier this year. The audience cheered for the performance, and Hudson was clearly impressed.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAPPER FLAU’JAE DELIVERS POWERFUL PERFORMANCE IN ‘AGT: ALL-STARS’ EARLY RELEASE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rapper-received-a-golden-buzzer-on-agt>The Rapper Received a Golden Buzzer on AGT</h2><p>For those who may not remember, Johnson first auditioned for AGT in Season 13, when she was just 14 years old. She impressed the judges with her original song “Guns Down,” in which she spoke out against gun violence.</p><p>Later, in the Judge Cuts, the young rapper earned the Golden Buzzer from guest judge Chris Hardwick after she performed another original song called “I Can’t Lose.” This sent her straight to the Quarterfinals. Unfortunately, she was eliminated at this stage of the competition.</p><p>Johnson returned for All-Stars earlier this year, but she didn’t earn enough votes from the Superfans to make it into the Finals.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Masked-Singer-Olivia-Culpo1-220x146.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Recap: UFO Is Unmasked in the Quarterfinals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZquklr9ussuarKOZlWK3sLTNrKanZaKWvbR5zqdkraCVYremus2inZ6qXZ3Cpb%2FOp2SsoJ%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
