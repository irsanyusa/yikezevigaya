With over 500 million copies of her books sold internationally, she was one of the world's best-selling writers.</p><p>Starting her career in the arts, Jackie Collins ventured into acting with minor roles in British films. Finding her passion in writing, however, she eventually published her first novel The World Is Full of Married Men (1968), which would be banned in several countries. This controversy helped propel her into the spotlight, and she continued with works like The Stud (1969) and Sinners (1971).</p><p>Moving to Los Angeles, Collins entered into the environment that would inspire her biggest hit, Hollywood Wives (1983).
