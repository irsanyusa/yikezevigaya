The tribunal supported Suswam's claim, stating that irregularities occurred in five out of seven local governments in the Senatorial District.</p><p>As a result, the tribunal nullified 51,895 votes counted for Senator Udende and 21,229 votes for Senator Suswam. Following the cancellation of padded votes, Suswam's tally reduced to 90,590, while Udende's stood at 82,699 votes.</p><p>The judgement in Suswam’s favor, which was initially delivered by the Justice <strong>Ori Zik-Ikeoha</strong> led panel, has been overturned by the Court of Appeal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46cpq6qpGLAoq%2FKrGSfp6KisrN5wZ6lrp1dnLy3sdGnpqtll5avs7XEpWSsraOsrq55xaumpmWjmruiwMRoqaVxYJ2ypg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
